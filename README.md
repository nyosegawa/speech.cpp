# speech.cpp

Speech synthesis in C++ on [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml), as a library with a C API
(`include/speech.h`) and the programs built on it, among them the worker process that
[ASIST](https://github.com/nyosegawa/asist) starts. It targets Metal, Vulkan and CUDA; it is checked on
Metal, on Vulkan (NVIDIA) and on the CPU. Every stage of a port is checked against the official
implementation.

## Binaries

[Releases](https://github.com/nyosegawa/speech.cpp/releases) carry, for macOS arm64 (Metal) and Windows x64
(Vulkan), `speech-worker-<version>-<platform>.zip` with the worker alone, which is what ASIST bundles, and
`speech-cpp-tools-<version>-<platform>.zip` with the command-line tools and the shared library with its
header (`libspeech.dylib`, or `speech.dll` with its import library `speech.lib`, and `speech.h`), with their
SHA-256 sums. The Vulkan build needs no particular driver version; on the first run the GPU driver compiles its
shaders, which takes seconds and is cached by the driver until it is updated. The Metal build compiles its
kernels on its first run as well (16 s for an Irodori-TTS worker on an Apple M5, 1.5 s on the runs after).

## Build

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nyosegawa/speech.cpp.git
cd speech.cpp
cmake -B build                  # Metal on macOS, the CPU elsewhere
cmake --build build --config Release -j
```

For Vulkan or CUDA, configure with `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON` (the Vulkan SDK is needed to build) or
`-DGGML_CUDA=ON` instead.

The build makes the library twice from the same sources: statically into every executable, so that each
tool is one file with ggml inside, and as the shared library `libspeech` (`libspeech.dylib`, `libspeech.so`,
`speech.dll`), which exports the functions of `speech.h` and nothing else. It also builds the checks, which
need the weights and the reference dumps to run.

On Metal, every tool turns off Metal 4's tensor API before it starts a device. ggml uses that API on the
M5 and later chips, and its matrix kernel in ggml v0.25.3 writes past its output when the output has 64
modulo 128 columns; on an M5 this turned a codec window of 64 frames into noise
([#13](https://github.com/nyosegawa/speech.cpp/issues/13)). Without it Metal comes closer to the CPU, and on
the M5 Irodori-TTS takes a fifth to a third longer to its first audio while Qwen3-TTS keeps its speed.

## Layout

- `include/speech.h` is the C API, the one way into the library.
- `src/` is the library: `speech.cpp` implements the C API over one engine per family,
  `src/families/<family>/` runs one architecture of model, whichever weights it is given, and `src/common/`
  holds what the families share.
- `tools/` holds the programs built on the library: the worker (`tools/worker/`) and a command-line tool per
  family.
- `checks/` holds a check per ported stage that compares it with the official implementation, and
  `speech-api-check`, which runs the C API through the shared library.
- `reference/<model>/` pins the official implementation in a uv environment, converts its weights to GGUF
  and dumps the tensors the checks compare with.

## The C API

`include/speech.h` declares everything; this is the shape of a program that speaks one sentence:

```c
#include "speech.h"

static int on_audio(const float * samples, size_t n, void * user_data) {
    /* n mono float samples at speech_model_sample_rate(); n is 0 between Irodori-TTS's sampler steps.
       Returning nonzero stops the request. */
    return 0;
}

speech_model_params params = speech_model_default_params();
params.model_path = "irodori-tts-v4.1-small-mf-f16.gguf";
params.codec_path = "semantic-dacvae-japanese-32dim-f32.gguf";
speech_voice_source voice = {"bright", "bright-young-woman-10s.voice.gguf"};
params.voices = &voice;
params.n_voices = 1;

speech_model * model;
if (speech_model_load(&params, &model) != SPEECH_OK) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", speech_last_error());
    return 1;
}
speech_request request = {"明日の東京は晴れです。", "bright", NULL, 42};
speech_status status = speech_synthesize(model, &request, on_audio, NULL);
speech_model_free(model);
```

- **Devices.** `speech_device_count()` and `speech_device_get()` list what the library can run on, with the
  memory of each; `params.device` takes a device's name, `"cpu"`, or `"gpu"`/NULL for the first GPU.
- **Models.** `speech_model_load()` chooses the family from `general.architecture` of the model's GGUF and
  takes Qwen3-TTS's context and Irodori-TTS's voices (WAVE or voice files) and steps. The `speech_model_*`
  getters describe the loaded model: its name, architecture, sample rate, how it streams, its voices and
  languages, whether the language reaches the model, its steps and its backend.
- **Requests.** `speech_synthesize()` speaks a text in a voice, in a language or `auto`, from a seed, and
  passes the audio to the callback as it is made. It returns `SPEECH_OK`, `SPEECH_STOPPED` when the callback
  or `speech_cancel()` stopped it, or `SPEECH_ERROR`.
- **Voice files.** `speech_make_voice()` writes an Irodori-TTS voice file from a reference WAVE file.
- **Errors.** A function that can fail returns `SPEECH_ERROR`, and `speech_last_error()` gives the message
  on the same thread. No C++ exception crosses the API.
- **Ownership.** Every string the library returns is its own: a device's strings live as long as the
  process, a model's until `speech_model_free()`, the error message until the next call on the thread.
  Nothing the caller passes is kept after the call.
- **Threads.** A model speaks one request at a time; concurrent `speech_synthesize()` calls on it wait for
  each other. `speech_cancel()` and the getters may be called from any thread. Separate models are
  independent.
- **Versions.** `SPEECH_API_VERSION` and `speech_api_version()` give the version of the API, raised when a
  change is one an existing caller notices.

Link `libspeech` (on Windows, define `SPEECH_SHARED` and link `speech.lib`), or, within this CMake project,
the target `speech` (shared) or `speech-static`.

## The worker

`speech-worker` is the process ASIST starts, a program on the C API like any other. It reads one JSON
request per line on stdin and answers on stdout, each line prefixed with `ASIST_JSON:`, and runs the family
that `general.architecture` of the model GGUF names.

```sh
speech-worker qwen3-tts-0.6b-customvoice-q8_0.gguf qwen3-tts-codec-12hz-f16.gguf
speech-worker irodori-tts-v4.1-small-mf-f16.gguf semantic-dacvae-japanese-32dim-f32.gguf \
    --voice bright=bright-young-woman-10s.voice.gguf --voice calm=calm-reference.wav
```

| Option | For | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--device NAME`, `gpu`, `cpu` | both | the device as `--devices` names it (`MTL0`, `Vulkan1`), the first GPU (the default) or the CPU |
| `--seed n` | both | the seed of the first request; each later request takes the next one. Without it the seed is random |
| `--ctx n` | Qwen3-TTS | the talker's context in positions (2048, about 160 s of speech) |
| `--voice NAME=FILE` | Irodori-TTS | a voice, repeated for more: a reference WAVE file or a voice file (below). At least one is needed |
| `--steps n` | Irodori-TTS | the sampler's steps: 4 for v4.1-Small-MF and 40 for v4.1-Small unless given |

`speech-worker --devices` prints the devices it can run on, with their memory, and exits.

The messages, one JSON object per line:

| Direction | Message |
|---|---|
| out | `{"type":"ready","model":"Irodori-TTS-v4.1-Small-MF","architecture":"irodori-tts","sampleRate":48000,"streaming":"sentence","voices":["bright","calm"],"languages":["ja"],"languageSelectable":false,"steps":4,"backend":"MTL0"}` |
| in | `{"id":"1","text":"明日の東京は晴れです。","voice":"bright"}`, with `"language"` and `"speed"` optional |
| out | `{"type":"chunk","id":"1","seq":0,"pcm":"<base64 of 16-bit little-endian mono PCM at sampleRate>"}`, one or more |
| out | `{"type":"end","id":"1","samples":278400}` |
| out | `{"type":"error","id":"1","error":"..."}` when a request cannot be spoken |
| out | `{"type":"fatal","error":"..."}` when the worker cannot start |
| in | `{"type":"cancel","id":"1"}`: the request stops between two chunks (Irodori-TTS also between two of its sampler's steps, before the first chunk) and sends no `end`; a request cancelled before it starts is dropped |

Requests are served one at a time in arrival order. `speed` is accepted and has no effect.

`languages` lists the languages as BCP 47 tags. A request's `language`, when given, must be one of them or
a region or script of one (`ja`, `ja-JP`, `zh-Hant`), or `auto`; `auto` or no `language` leaves the choice
to the model. Any other language is an error.

- **Qwen3-TTS** streams frame by frame (`"streaming":"frame"`, 24 kHz). Its voices are the model's speakers,
  and it speaks `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `pt`, `ru` and `zh` (`"languageSelectable":true`):
  the language goes into its prompt. Two speakers speak a Chinese dialect, `dylan` (Beijing) and `eric`
  (Sichuan), when the language is `zh` or left to the model, as in the official implementation.
- **Irodori-TTS** makes a sentence at once and streams it as the codec decodes it (`"streaming":"sentence"`,
  48 kHz), so a request should be one sentence; a text longer than the model's 256 tokens is refused. Its
  voices are those given with `--voice`. It speaks `ja` and is not told a language
  (`"languageSelectable":false`).

### Irodori-TTS voices

Irodori-TTS has no voices of its own; it speaks in the voice of a reference. A voice is either:

- a reference WAVE file: 48 kHz (other rates are refused), at most 120 s, 16-, 24- or 32-bit PCM or 32-bit
  float, the channels averaged. The worker normalizes its loudness and encodes it with the codec when it
  starts, as the official runtime does for every request.
- a voice file, which `irodori-tts --make-voice` or `speech_make_voice()` writes from a reference WAVE file: the reference's codec
  latent in a GGUF that names the codec it was made with (a voice file of another codec is refused).

```sh
irodori-tts --make-voice irodori-tts-v4.1-small-mf-f16.gguf semantic-dacvae-japanese-32dim-f32.gguf \
    bright-young-woman-10s.wav bright-young-woman-10s.voice.gguf --device cpu
```

For the 10.7 s reference bright-young-woman-10s.wav, the voice file is 35 KB against the WAVE file's 1 MB,
and loads in 0.016 s on an Apple M5 (Metal) and 0.025 s on an RTX 2080 (Vulkan), against 0.72 s and 0.43 s
to encode the WAVE file (5.05 s on the M5's CPU). Made on the CPU (`--device cpu`), its latent is the
official encoder's to 99 dB SNR; on Metal it is 40 dB and on Vulkan 33 dB (see Accuracy below). ASIST
carries voice files (docs/adr/0002).

## Qwen3-TTS

It decodes audio frame by frame with the same samples as decoding the whole utterance, so streaming does
not add artifacts at the frame boundaries. Implemented:

- the talker (a Qwen3 decoder) that predicts the first codebook of each frame,
- the code predictor that predicts the other 15 codebooks,
- the 12Hz codec decoder (RVQ dequantization, sliding-window transformer, ConvNeXt upsampling and the
  SnakeBeta decoder), with each stage's causal state carried from one call to the next,
- the Qwen2 byte-level BPE tokenizer and the CustomVoice prompt,
- sampling as in transformers' `generate()` (temperature, top-k, top-p, repetition penalty).

Voice cloning, VoiceDesign, the codec encoder and the speaker encoder are out of scope.

### Models

A synthesis needs one talker (`qwen3-tts-0.6b-customvoice-q8_0.gguf` or
`qwen3-tts-1.7b-customvoice-q8_0.gguf`) and the codec (`qwen3-tts-codec-12hz-f16.gguf`) from
[sakasegawa/qwen3-tts-ggml](https://huggingface.co/sakasegawa/qwen3-tts-ggml). To convert them yourself
from the official checkpoints:

```sh
cd reference/qwen3-tts
uv run python convert.py <Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice dir> ../../models/gguf --type q8_0 --codec-type f16
```

### Use

```sh
build/qwen3-tts <talker.gguf> <codec.gguf> ono_anna ja "明日の東京は晴れです。" out.wav
```

`speech-worker <talker.gguf> <codec.gguf>` runs it behind the worker protocol (above).

### Accuracy

`reference/qwen3-tts/dump.py` runs the official implementation with greedy decoding and saves the tensors
of every stage; the check tools compare against them.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Codec decoder, whole utterance, CPU, F32 (`codec-check`) | 114 dB SNR against the official decoder |
| Codec decoder, one frame at a time against whole, CPU | 133 dB SNR |
| Codec decoder on Metal | error at -63 dB of the voice |
| Talker and code predictor, F32, teacher forcing (`talker-check`) | argmax matches on every frame; greedy decode gives the same 54 frames |
| Tokenizer (`tokenizer-check`) | matches the model's `tokenizer.json` on 19 texts |

The tokenizer follows the pre-tokenizer of the `tokenizer.json` that ships with the model. The official
package loads it through transformers 4.57.3 with `fix_mistral_regex=True`, which swaps in Mistral's
pattern; the two differ on Latin words in mixed case, contractions and `/`.

### Speed

Q8_0 weights, Japanese sentences, after the shaders are compiled:

| Model | Device | First audio | Real-time factor | VRAM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.6B | Apple M5, Metal | 0.04 s | 0.38 | |
| 1.7B | Apple M5, Metal | 0.07 s | 0.48 | |
| 0.6B | RTX 2080, Vulkan | 0.07 s | 0.31 | 1.6 GB |
| 1.7B | RTX 2080, Vulkan | 0.08 s | 0.36 | 2.7 GB |

## Irodori-TTS

[Irodori-TTS](https://github.com/Aratako/Irodori-TTS) by Aratako: a DiT that makes the 32-dimensional latent of
a 48 kHz codec (Semantic-DACVAE-Japanese-32dim) for a whole sentence, its length set beforehand by a
duration predictor. Implemented, for v4.1-Small-MF (4 MeanFlow steps) and v4.1-Small (Euler steps with the
runtime's guidance, text 3.0 and speaker 5.0 while t ≥ 0.5):

- the official text normalization, with NFKC from Unicode 13.0 as the official runtime's Python has it,
- the SentencePiece Unigram tokenizer with byte fallback, and ModernBERT-ja with its projector,
- the reference's loudness normalization and the codec encoder, in windows of 100 frames,
- the speaker encoder, the duration predictor, the DiT and both samplers,
- the tail cut where the latent goes flat, and the codec decoder, a first window of 12 frames (0.48 s) and
  then 48 at a time, each window giving the samples of decoding the whole latent at once.

Not implemented: captions (VoiceDesign), speaker-inversion embeddings, SilentCipher's watermark,
`duration_scale`, and resampling a reference that is not at 48 kHz. The noise comes from speech.cpp's own
generator, so a seed gives other audio than the same seed in the official runtime.

### Models

A synthesis needs one model (`irodori-tts-v4.1-small-mf-f16.gguf` or `irodori-tts-v4.1-small-f16.gguf`) and
the codec (`semantic-dacvae-japanese-32dim-f32.gguf`) from
[sakasegawa/irodori-tts-ggml](https://huggingface.co/sakasegawa/irodori-tts-ggml), whose card lists their
SHA-256. To convert them yourself from the pinned official checkpoints:

```sh
cd reference/irodori-tts
uv run python convert.py mf ../../models --type f16       # irodori-tts-v4.1-small-mf-f16.gguf, 1.5 GB
uv run python convert.py rf ../../models --type f16       # irodori-tts-v4.1-small-f16.gguf, 1.5 GB
uv run python convert_codec.py ../../models --type f32    # semantic-dacvae-japanese-32dim-f32.gguf, 371 MB
```

`--type` also takes `f32` and `q8_0` (0.8 GB). Qwen3-ASR 1.7B transcribed the 20 sentences of the speed
table below with 2.99% CER in F32 and in F16, and 3.81% in Q8_0, which garbled one phrase.

### Use

```sh
build/irodori-tts irodori-tts-v4.1-small-mf-f16.gguf semantic-dacvae-japanese-32dim-f32.gguf \
    bright-young-woman-10s.voice.gguf "明日の東京は晴れです。" out.wav [--device NAME] [--seed n] [--steps n]
```

### Accuracy

`reference/irodori-tts/dump.py` runs the official implementation on the CPU in float32 with fixed noise and
saves every stage; the check tools compare each stage, given the dump's own inputs, with it. Apple M5:

| Check | CPU, F32 | Metal, F32 | Vulkan, F16 model and F32 codec |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normalization and tokenizer, 51 texts (`irodori-text-check`) | all equal | all equal | all equal |
| Text condition (`irodori-text-check`) | 118 to 123 dB SNR | 65 to 123 dB | 65 to 74 dB |
| Reference latent (`irodori-codec-check`) | 99 dB | 40 dB | 33 dB |
| Speaker condition (`irodori-condition-check`) | 111 dB | 51 dB | 51 dB |
| Predicted length | the official frames on every dump | the same | the same |
| DiT steps, MF and RF (`irodori-dit-check`) | 95 dB or more | 46 dB or more | 63 dB or more (MF) |
| Sampled latent, MF / RF 40 steps | 86 to 122 dB / 109 to 111 dB | 36 to 67 dB / 59 to 67 dB | 66 dB (MF, 27 frames) |
| Decoded audio (`irodori-codec-check`) | 119 dB | 68 dB | 68 dB |
| Decoding in windows against at once | equal | equal | 89 dB (encoder), equal (decoder) |
| Whole synthesis from the dump's noise (`irodori-synthesis-check`) | 75 to 110 dB, the same length | 22 to 61 dB, the same length | 58 dB (MF, 27 frames), the same length |

The Metal and Vulkan columns were measured on an Apple M5 and an RTX 2080 with driver 591.86.

Metal's matrix kernel rounds both its inputs to half precision (`kernel_mul_mm_f32_f32` keeps its tiles as
`half`), which is the gap between the CPU and Metal; MeanFlow's four large steps carry it into the latent,
so on Metal the audio is the same speech rather than the same waveform. Vulkan accumulates in float32 as
the port asks. The codec on a GPU is checked against the CPU as well: on Metal its error lies 68 dB below the
voice and on Vulkan 68 dB, and the quietest tenth of the 20 ms frames stays as quiet as on the CPU (-78 and
-76 dBFS against -76). audio.cpp v0.8.2's Irodori-TTS adds a distorted copy of the voice 14 dB below it on
Metal and raises the quiet parts to -60 dBFS.

### Speed

The 20 sentences of speech-bench's prompts/speak-ja-JP.json through `speech-worker` in the voice file above,
one request at a time, after the worker is ready:

| Model | Device | Median first audio | p90 first audio | Real-time factor | Memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v4.1-Small-MF F16, 4 steps | Apple M5, Metal | 0.23 s | 0.51 s | 0.17 | 2.2 GB |
| v4.1-Small-MF Q8_0, 4 steps | Apple M5, Metal | 0.25 s | 0.51 s | 0.18 | 1.5 GB |
| v4.1-Small F16, 16 steps | Apple M5, Metal | 1.12 s | 3.29 s | 0.34 | 2.2 GB |
| v4.1-Small F16, 40 steps | Apple M5, Metal | 2.64 s | 8.04 s | 0.64 | 2.2 GB |
| v4.1-Small-MF F16, 4 steps | RTX 2080, Vulkan | 0.13 s | 0.23 s | 0.10 | 2.1 GB |
| v4.1-Small-MF Q8_0, 4 steps | RTX 2080, Vulkan | 0.13 s | 0.22 s | 0.07 | 1.5 GB |
| v4.1-Small F16, 16 steps | RTX 2080, Vulkan | 0.49 s | 1.13 s | 0.14 | 2.2 GB |

audio.cpp v0.8.2 took 1.22 s (M5) and 0.80 s (RTX 2080) to the median first audio with v4.1-Small at 16
steps, answering with the whole sentence. Memory is the worker's peak memory footprint on the M5 and the
rise of the GPU's memory on the RTX 2080, with the F32 codec. The first audio comes after the text, the
whole sampler and the codec's first window, so it grows with the sentence.
