</p>

speech.cpp is one command, `speech`, and one shared library, `libspeech`, behind one C API, on the CPU, Metal and
Vulkan through [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml). The command speaks text, writes the text of recordings, finds
where someone speaks in them, transcribes the microphone as someone speaks (`speech asr --live`), serves OpenAI's audio
API and its Realtime transcription over HTTP, and runs a worker process for any program that keeps models loaded between
requests, [ASIST](https://github.com/nyosegawa/asist) among them.

**The first audio in a quarter of a second or less.** On an Apple M5, Qwen3-TTS 0.6B sends its first audio 0.04 s
after the text and Irodori-TTS 0.25 s after it, and the rest follows while it plays.

**One executable, nothing else to install.** No Python and no CUDA: `speech` fetches each model by name, one GGUF file
with its codec, and runs it on Metal, Vulkan or the CPU.

**OpenAI's API on your own computer.** `speech serve` answers OpenAI's audio API and its Realtime transcription, so an
OpenAI client works by changing its base URL.

**Checked against the official implementations.** Every stage of every model is compared with the model's official
implementation, from the same inputs.

A command takes a model by its name and fetches its converted file from Hugging Face, from the repository the name links
to, the first time. [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) lists the models with their sizes, voices and languages, and each
family has a page: [Qwen3-TTS](docs/models/qwen3-tts.md), [Irodori-TTS](docs/models/irodori-tts.md),
[FastConformer](docs/models/fastconformer.md), [Qwen3-ASR](docs/models/qwen3-asr.md) and
[Silero VAD](docs/models/silero-vad.md).

## Install

macOS on Apple silicon and Linux on x86-64:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nyosegawa/speech.cpp/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows x64, in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nyosegawa/speech.cpp/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer checks the release's archive against its SHA-256, puts `speech` under your home folder, and adds it to
`PATH`. Run it again to update. On Linux it installs the Vulkan build when the Vulkan loader is installed, and the CPU
build otherwise; the Linux builds need glibc 2.34 or later. [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) has the options, how to
uninstall, and what each platform needs. On an Intel Mac or another system, [build from source](docs/install.md#build-from-source).

## Quick start

1. Speak a sentence. The model is fetched the first time (1.21 GB):

   ```sh
   speech tts qwen3-tts-0.6b --voice ryan -o hello.wav "Hello. It will be sunny in Tokyo tomorrow."
   ```

2. Write its text back (0.84 GB the first time):

   ```sh
   speech asr qwen3-asr-0.6b hello.wav
   ```

   ```
   Hello, it will be sunny in Tokyo tomorrow.
   ```

3. Open a page on which to pick models, speak and transcribe:

   ```sh
   speech serve --open
   ```

`speech models` lists every model and, for each language, the model to start with.

## Command line

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `speech tts` | speaks text into a WAVE file or to stdout |
| `speech asr` | writes the text of WAVE files, or of the microphone as someone speaks |
| `speech vad` | writes where someone speaks in WAVE files |
| `speech voice` | makes an Irodori-TTS voice file from reference recordings |
| `speech info` | prints what a model file says of its model |
| `speech devices` | lists the devices a model can run on |
| `speech models`, `pull`, `rm` | list, fetch and remove models |
| `speech quantize` | writes a model file of F32 weights in F16, Q8_0 or a smaller type |
| `speech serve` | serves models over HTTP with OpenAI's audio API, and a page to try them |
| `speech worker` | serves a model over JSON Lines on stdin and stdout, for programs |

```sh
speech voice irodori-tts-mf me.wav me.voice.gguf
speech tts irodori-tts-mf --add-voice me=me.voice.gguf --voice me -o - < story.txt | ffplay -nodisp -autoexit -
speech asr reazonspeech-v2 --timestamps meeting.wav
speech asr qwen3-asr-1.7b --language ja --prompt "Claude Code、渋谷" meeting.wav
speech asr reazonspeech-v2 --vad silero-vad --live
speech vad silero-vad --max-speech-duration-s 10 meeting.wav
```

Every request option is a flag, and `speech info MODEL` lists the ones a model takes. [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) lists
every subcommand and option.

## Server and page

`speech serve` holds a synthesis model, a recognition model and a detection model, and answers
`POST /v1/audio/speech` and `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` as OpenAI's audio API does, for a web app, a script or curl:

```sh
speech serve qwen3-tts-0.6b qwen3-asr-0.6b
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/speech -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"input": "Hello.", "voice": "ryan"}' -o hello.wav
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions -F file=@hello.wav
```

It listens on 127.0.0.1 and has no authentication. [docs/server.md](docs/server.md) has the endpoints, the formats, the
errors and the page.

## Using the library

A program links `libspeech` and includes `speech.h`, from a release archive:

```c
speech_model * model = NULL;
speech_request * request = NULL;
speech_model_load("Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice-Q8_0.gguf", NULL, &model);
speech_request_new(model, &request);
speech_request_set_text(request, "Hello.");
speech_request_set_string(request, SPEECH_OPT_VOICE, "ryan");
speech_synthesize(request, on_audio, NULL);   /* on_audio receives the samples as they are made */
```

Each call returns a status whose category says what failed. [docs/c-api.md](docs/c-api.md) has the whole API.

A program that would rather not link a library starts `speech worker MODEL` and speaks JSON Lines with it, as ASIST
does: one request per line on stdin, its audio or text and one terminal message on stdout.
[docs/worker.md](docs/worker.md) has the protocol.

## Accuracy and speed

Every stage of each port is compared with tensors dumped from the official implementation. The recognizers write the
official text on every check input in F32 and F16.

Measured with [speech-bench](https://github.com/nyosegawa/speech-bench) on 2026-10-08, on an Apple M5 (Metal) and an
RTX 2080 (Vulkan), one request at a time. Speech: 20 Japanese sentences, the time to the first audio, the real-time
factor, and the CER of the speech as Qwen3-ASR 1.7B hears it.

| Model | First audio, M5 / RTX 2080 | Real-time factor | CER |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen3-tts-0.6b`, Q8_0 | 0.04 s / 0.03 s | 0.31 / 0.27 | 5.8% / 8.0% |
| `qwen3-tts-1.7b`, Q8_0 | 0.06 s / 0.04 s | 0.42 / 0.32 | 3.0% / 2.8% |
| `irodori-tts-mf`, F16 | 0.25 s / 0.12 s | 0.17 / 0.07 | 6.1% / 7.1% |
| `irodori-tts`, F16, 16 steps | 1.24 s / 0.52 s | 0.34 / 0.13 | 3.2% / 3.2% |

Recognition: the 4,483 utterances of Common Voice 8.0's Japanese test set, trimmed to the voice, with the CER that
accepts other spellings of the same words in parentheses, and parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3 on 300 English utterances of FLEURS.

| Model | CER on Common Voice ja | Median time, M5 / RTX 2080 |
|---|---|---|
| `parakeet-tdt_ctc-0.6b-ja`, F16 | 7.9% (3.0%) | 0.06 s / 0.07 s |
| `reazonspeech-v2`, F16 | 12.0% (7.1%) | 0.11 s / 0.16 s |
| `qwen3-asr-0.6b`, Q8_0 | 11.9% (7.0%) | 0.13 s / 0.09 s |
| `qwen3-asr-1.7b`, Q8_0 | 9.5% (4.7%) | 0.31 s / 0.16 s |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`, F16 | WER 8.8% on FLEURS en | 0.10 s / 0.15 s |

Each model's page has more.
