/*
 * The C API of speech.cpp on ggml: speech synthesis and speech recognition with the models of the families the
 * library runs. A model does one task (speech_model_info_task()): a synthesis model turns the text of a request into
 * audio through speech_synthesize(), and a recognition model turns the audio of a request into text through
 * speech_transcribe().
 *
 * What a request may ask of a model is one vocabulary of options (speech_option), each with a fixed name that the
 * worker, the HTTP server and the command line use verbatim. Each family declares which options it takes, with their
 * type, default and range or choices, and the library checks every value a caller sets against that declaration as
 * it is set. The same declaration is readable before the model is loaded, through speech_model_info_open(), so a
 * caller learns what a model takes without trying. An option a model does not take is an error, except at the
 * option's neutral value, which every model accepts.
 *
 * Every string passed in or returned is UTF-8, paths included. A function that can fail returns a speech_status; on
 * failure speech_last_error() gives the message and speech_last_error_option() the input it concerns. Every object
 * the library returns is freed only through the function named for it, and every string it returns lives as long as
 * the object it was read from unless the declaration says otherwise. Nothing the caller passes in is kept after the
 * call returns.
 *
 * Threads: a model serves one request at a time, so requests that several threads start on the same model run one
 * after another. A request is used by one thread at a time, except for speech_request_cancel(), which any thread may
 * call while the request exists. Model information never changes once made and may be read from any thread.
 * Different models are independent of each other.
 *
 * The library checks what it is given before ggml sees it, so that no input a caller passes makes ggml abort the
 * process.
