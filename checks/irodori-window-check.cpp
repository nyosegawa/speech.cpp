// Checks the rule by which Irodori-TTS's decoder sizes its windows after the first (next_window()) on simulated
// machines that decode a frame in a set time: one as fast as an Apple M5, one half as fast, one that slows down after
// the first window, and one slower than real time. Each speaks a sentence of 145 frames (5.8 s) and one of 685 (27.4 s)
// as Codec::decode() would, its estimate of the time per frame made as decode() makes it, and the listener plays from
// the first window on. It fails unless every window lies from the floor to the ceiling or is the frames left; the fast
// machine keeps 0.7.1's 48 frames with the margin in hand; the slow one never runs dry, where 48-frame windows do; the
// one that slows to where 24-frame windows are slower than real time and 48-frame ones are not keeps the ceiling and
// never runs dry; and the one slower than real time takes the ceiling.
//
