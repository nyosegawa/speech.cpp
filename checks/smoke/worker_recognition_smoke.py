"""Drives `speech worker` with a recognition model through its protocol the way a caller does, with every line checked by
worker_client.py: one JSON object per line, and one terminal message per request and nothing after it.

It sends the audio of each dump of reference/fastconformer/dump.py or reference/qwen3-asr/dump.py as 16-bit chunks of
one second and checks that the text is the dump's, the languages the one qwen-asr parsed by its tag or none (for
FastConformer, which writes none, a member left out), and the stop complete, for each request a Qwen3-ASR dump holds
with its forced language and its prompt and each decoding other than the default that a FastConformer dump holds, that
a language the model only checks changes nothing, and with timestamps, where the model takes them, that the segments
and tokens join into the text in time order; that the chunks of two requests may interleave and the requests are
answered in the order of their transcribes; cancels while a request collects chunks (whose later lines are dropped and
whose id a chunk 0 starts again), while it waits and while it runs; that audio at three times the model's rate is
recognized; each error with its code and option (a chunk out of order, not base64 or of odd bytes, a sample rate
missing or 0, an unknown language or member, a prompt the model does not take or too long, a decoding it does not take
or does not have, audio missing, the other task's messages); info, also answered while a recognition runs, and the
model information of ready; progress for a recognition that runs for more than two seconds, which the worker reports
a second after the request starts and then at most once a second; and the error of a request still collecting chunks
when stdin closes.

The audio goes as 16-bit samples, which move the near-silent input of reference/qwen3-asr/dump.py far enough to change
the text a forced language makes of it; leave that dump out.
