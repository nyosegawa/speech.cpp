// Utterance assembly: audio that arrives a piece at a time, at a rate given when the assembly starts, cut into
// utterances, each recognized alone, as transcription by regions recognizes a whole recording. With a detection, the
// utterances are the regions where someone speaks, which the detection gives sample for sample as speech_detect() gives
// them for the whole audio; without one, the caller commits each utterance, all the audio appended since the last
// commit. While an utterance goes on, its beginning is read again and again, and the beginning that two readings in a
// row agree on goes out as deltas, which only ever add text; once it is committed, it is recognized whole, and that
// recognition, which may differ from the deltas, completes it. The events go out in order: an utterance's speech started,
// its deltas, its speech stopped and its commit, then its completion, with the next utterance's events begun meanwhile.
