// A session of OpenAI's Realtime transcription, as its API reference gives the GA events at github.com/openai/
// openai-openapi commit 234829e (2026-10-07): the client's session.update, input_audio_buffer.append, .commit and
// .clear, and the server's session.created, session.updated, input_audio_buffer.speech_started, .speech_stopped,
// .committed and .cleared, conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta, .completed and .failed, and error. The
// session reads and checks each client event, keeps its configuration, and gives the audio to an assembly of utterances
// (utterances.h), which cuts it by the regions of the detection model with turn_detection server_vad, or at the client's
// commits without it, and recognizes each utterance, and its beginning while it goes on for the deltas; it writes the
// server's events as JSON text, and whoever carries the messages (the server's WebSocket) hands it the client's and
// sends its own. A member or a value speech.cpp does not take is answered with an error event rather than ignored.
