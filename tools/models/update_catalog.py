"""Writes tools/models/catalog.json again, pinning each model at its Hugging Face repository's current revision.

What a person chose stays as catalog.json has it: each model's name, its repository, the type of the file its name
alone names, and the languages it is the model to start with. The rest is read from Hugging Face: the repository's
commit, each GGUF file at that commit with its size and SHA-256 from the Hub's API, and the type, task, languages and
whether the model takes voice files from the output of `speech info --json` that the repository holds beside each
file. A release lists the files it was checked with, so this runs whenever a repository's files change, and its diff
is reviewed like code. It refuses a catalog it would write wrong: a name a model argument cannot hold, a type the
repository has no file of, files of one model that disagree on its task or languages, a language to start with that
the model does not take or that two models of a task claim, and a file whose JSON gives another size.

To add a model, add its name, repository, type and start to catalog.json and run this.
