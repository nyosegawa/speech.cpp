"""Checks `speech serve` with a model of each task and its page: the page's files, its endpoints under /speech/, the
protections around them, the OpenAI endpoints with two models held, and the replacement of a model by the page.

The model files are local copies of the catalog's files, found by their size and SHA-256 and linked into a model
folder of the script's own (SPEECH_MODEL_DIR), so that loading one by its name fetches nothing. It checks:

- a server given no model and no --open, and --open on another address than a loopback one: exit 2;
- the page: GET / with its Content-Security-Policy, every file it and its modules name, a file it does not have, and a
  Host that is not 127.0.0.1, localhost or [::1] with the server's port, refused;
- the token: GET /speech/models, POST /speech/load and POST /speech/voices without it (401), with a wrong one (403),
  and with it but from a foreign Origin or for a foreign Host (403); with it, the catalog as `speech models --json`
  gives it and the models held, from the server's own origin as well as from none;
- every endpoint refusing a foreign Origin, the OpenAI ones included, preflights too, while a request without one (curl,
  scripts) and one from --cors-origin's origin pass;
- the OpenAI endpoints with the two models: /v1/models lists both, speech and a transcription of that speech, and a
  request naming the model of the other task refused;
- a load of a name outside the catalog (404), of a model file's path (400) and of a body it does not take (400);
- switching: the page loads the third model in place of its task's, a second load of that task meanwhile is refused
  (409), the endpoint of that task serves the new model while the other task's stays, and the first model comes back
  by its catalog name;
- a fetch the page stops: the load of a model not in the folder, closed at its first progress, leaves a part and the
  model held as it was (a few megabytes come from Hugging Face; the part is removed after);
- a load whose page goes away while it waits for another process's lock on the file, which that process then puts in
  place, leaves the model held as it was;
- a voice added to a model that takes voice files, or refused by one that does not;
- with a detection model, the place of detection, empty until the page loads that model into it by its catalog name,
  a transcription with chunking_strategy refused before and answered after, and /v1/models listing it third;
- a server on 0.0.0.0, which has no page and answers its endpoints with how to reach them (on Windows its firewall may
  ask about it).
