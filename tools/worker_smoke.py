"""Drives `speech worker` with a synthesis model through its protocol the way a caller does, with every line checked by
worker_client.py: one JSON object per line, and one terminal message per request and nothing after it.

It checks ready (the release, and the model information of `speech info --json` with the device, the
threads and the voices of --add-voice), info and count_tokens, also answered while a synthesis runs; that a seed repeats the audio and a drawn seed is
reported and repeats it too; cancels while a request waits, while it runs, of an unknown id, and after an end, whose id
a later request then reuses; a second request under an id in flight; each error with its code and option (members the
message does not have, values of the wrong type, out of range or not taken, a missing text, lines that are not JSON
objects or have no id or type, the other task's messages); chunks to a synthesis model; add_voice; for
Irodori-TTS a fixed length and the progress of a long sampler, for Qwen3-TTS max_seconds and the sampling options, and
an instruction where the model takes one and its refusal where it does not. Writes the first answer to a WAV.

usage: python3 tools/worker_smoke.py <out.wav> <speech> <model.gguf> [worker options...]
       A model that takes voice files needs --add-voice NAME=FILE, whose FILE add_voice adds again under another name.
