// its errors as HTTP answers, and the events of an SSE stream. The shapes follow
// OpenAI's API reference, components CreateSpeechRequest, CreateTranscriptionRequest, CreateTranscriptionResponseJson,
// CreateTranscriptionResponseVerboseJson, TranscriptionSegment, Error, SpeechAudioDeltaEvent and SpeechAudioDoneEvent
// and the path /audio/transcriptions of github.com/openai/openai-openapi at commit 31af4fc (2026-10-05), and its
// chunking_strategy as TranscriptionChunkingStrategy and VadConfig give it at commit 234829e (2026-10-07), whose object
// openai-python 3.26.0 sends in a form as one field per member, chunking_strategy[type] and so on.
