// The page of `speech serve`, on which a user picks a model of each task from the catalog, fetches it and tries it:
// its files, written in tools/server/page/ and built into speech, and the endpoints that only the page calls, under
// /speech/: the catalog with the models held, loading a model of the catalog in place of its task's, and adding a
// voice made from a recording. The page speaks and transcribes through OpenAI's endpoints, as any client does. While
// the server listens elsewhere than on a loopback address, the page and its endpoints say how to reach them instead.
