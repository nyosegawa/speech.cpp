name: add-model
description: Port a speech model to speech.cpp, or update or extend one it has. Covers pinning the official implementation, dumping its tensors, converting to one GGUF file, the family's C++ port, stage-by-stage checks against the official code, request options, the entry points, the Hugging Face files and catalog, and measuring in speech-bench. Use when asked to add, port, support, convert or update a model or model family, or to expose an official option or feature of one (新しいモデルを追加、移植、対応、モデルの更新、公式のオプションに対応、変換し直し). Not for a defect in one existing stage, a documentation change (docs), or cutting a release (release).

# Adding or updating a model

A model in speech.cpp is trusted because every stage is compared with the official implementation and because a
request that asks nothing new gives what the previous release gave. Everything below protects those two promises.
Read AGENTS.md first; this skill adds the order of work and the checks that are easy to forget.

## 1. Before writing code

- **List the official request's every field** (the runtime's request object, `transcribe()`'s or `generate()`'s
  arguments, the server's form) and decide each one: a request option, a property of a voice file, or not offered,
  with the reason. Write the decision in an ADR before porting; a field found later changes the C API.
- **List what the checkpoint holds.** Dropping weights at conversion (a second head, a null speaker, a caption encoder)
  means a new layout later, an upgrade of every file users have, and a new upload. Drop nothing without an ADR saying
  why.
- Read the family's existing ADRs in docs/adr/ whose names cover the behaviour you change.

## 2. Reference, dumps and conversion

`reference/<family>/` holds the official code pinned by uv, `pins.py` pinning each checkpoint by revision, size and
SHA-256, `dump.py`, and `convert.py`. Read references/reference.md for what a dump must contain and how conversion
names keys, files and layouts.

- Dump every stage, with the noise fixed, for each new option and each setting a request can take. Use only audio
  that may be published (FLEURS, Common Voice); never a recording of a person who has not agreed to it.
- `convert.py` writes F32, which the checks run on; `speech quantize` makes every other type, each tensor as the
  family's `layout.cpp` table stores it (docs/adr/0040). Decide in that table which tensors a type may change.

## 3. The port

- `src/families/<family>/` reads one GGUF file through its `layout.cpp`, which says every key, every tensor and the
  types each tensor may take. A layout change raises `speech.layout`, adds the release that reads it, and brings the
  previous layout up in the family's one upgrade function, so that no user downloads a file again.
- The engine (`src/<family>-engine.cpp`) declares the options the model takes, with defaults and ranges read from the
  file. An option without effect, or a value the model cannot compute, is refused with the option named, never ignored.

## 4. Checks

Read references/checks.md before setting or loosening any bound.

- Each stage from the dump's own inputs, on the CPU in F32 to a tight bound, on Metal, and on Vulkan (windows-check).
  Tokens and text compare exactly; tensors compare by SNR.
- **Unchanged behaviour:** a request that sets none of the new options gives the previous release's float samples bit
  for bit (`tools/same_audio.py`), or the difference is measured and written down. The same seed gives the same
  output. A computation may follow the machine's speed (window or chunk sizes) only where every size gives the same
  samples, shown bit for bit on every backend.
- A check that fails without your change, wherever one can be written.

## 5. Entry points

- C API: new options go at the end of the vocabulary, marked with the minor version that adds them; the minor version
  rises once per release. Options a family does not take are refused by the table, not by code.
- Worker, server and command line take the option by its name; run every smoke script the change touches, with a model
  of each family (AGENTS.md's Workflow names them).

## 6. Synthesis or recognition

Read references/synthesis.md for voices, length, sampling, streaming, interruption and what the official output adds
that speech.cpp does not; references/recognition.md for decoding, prompts, languages, long audio and results.

## 7. Files, catalog and measurement

Read references/distribution.md. In short: one `sakasegawa/<Upstream>-GGUF` repository per upstream model with a card
and the `speech info --json` of each file beside it, uploaded only when the maintainer approves; then
`python3 tools/models/update_catalog.py`; then speech-bench's catalog and a measurement against the official
implementation and the other runtimes on the same day, on a quiet machine.

## 8. Finishing

- An ADR for every choice the code cannot show; the docs pages that describe the model (docs skill).
- One pull request per coherent unit (pull-request skill).

## Working in parallel

Several families can move at once in separate worktrees. ADR numbers collide; renumber at merge in the order the pull
requests land. Commit as each part works, so that a stopped session loses nothing. Run the long CPU F32 checks one
family at a time, and speed measurements only when nothing else runs.
