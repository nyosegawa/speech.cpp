# Server and page

This page describes `speech serve`, which serves a synthesis model, a recognition model and a detection model over HTTP
with a subset of OpenAI's audio API and its Realtime transcription, and a page on which to try models.

```
speech serve [MODEL [MODEL [MODEL]]] [--open] [--host 127.0.0.1] [--port 8080] [--cors-origin ORIGIN|*]...
             [--add-voice NAME=FILE]... [--device NAME] [--threads N] [--no-warmup]
```

```sh
speech serve --open                                   # the page, without a model until one is picked there
speech serve qwen3-tts-0.6b qwen3-asr-0.6b            # speech and transcriptions
speech serve reazonspeech-v2 silero-vad               # transcriptions, also by the regions where someone speaks
speech serve irodori-tts-mf --add-voice me=me.voice.gguf --cors-origin http://localhost:5173
```

The server holds at most one model of each task: synthesis, recognition and detection (Silero VAD), whose model
transcriptions with `chunking_strategy` and Realtime sessions with `server_vad` use. It loads the models given, listens once they are ready, and logs to stderr.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--host ADDRESS` | the address to listen on, 127.0.0.1 unless given. The server has no authentication and no TLS, so a server reachable from other machines belongs behind a proxy that adds them. The page is served only on 127.0.0.1, `::1` or `localhost` |
| `--port N` | the port, 8080 unless given, or 0 for any free one |
| `--open` | open the page in the browser once the server listens; without a MODEL the server starts with none |
| `--cors-origin ORIGIN` | an origin a web page may call the server from, such as `http://localhost:5173`, or `*` for any; repeatable. A web page of any other origin is refused (403 `origin_not_allowed`); curl and scripts send no origin and are not |
| `--add-voice NAME=FILE` | add a voice to the synthesis model |
| `--device`, `--threads`, `--no-warmup` | as for the worker, for the synthesis and recognition models the server loads, the page's included. A detection model runs on the CPU with one thread |

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | answers `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `GET /v1/models` | lists the models held, synthesis, recognition and detection in that order, as OpenAI's model objects whose `id` is the model's name, with `speech`, the model information ([c-api.md](c-api.md#model-information-as-json)) |
| `GET /v1/models/{id}` | one model; another id is a 404 (`model_not_found`) |
| `POST /v1/audio/speech` | speaks a text, as [OpenAI's create speech](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/audio/subresources/speech/methods/create) does |
| `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` | recognizes the speech in a WAV file, as [OpenAI's create transcription](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/audio/subresources/transcriptions/methods/create) does |
| `GET /v1/realtime` | a WebSocket that transcribes audio as it is sent, as [OpenAI's Realtime transcription](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/realtime/client-events) does ([below](#realtime-transcription)) |

An endpoint of a task the server holds no model of answers a 404 whose message says so. One whose model the page is
replacing answers a 503 (`model_loading`) with `Retry-After`.

Each model serves one request at a time, in the order they arrive. A client that disconnects stops its request.

## Speech

A speech request is a JSON object:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `input` | the text, required |
| `model` | the synthesis model's `id`, or left out. Any other model is a 404 (`model_not_found`) |
| `voice` | one of the model's voices, required: a Qwen3-TTS speaker or a voice of `--add-voice` |
| `response_format` | `wav` (the default) or `pcm`. OpenAI's default is `mp3`, which speech.cpp does not encode; `mp3`, `opus`, `aac` and `flac` are refused |
| `stream_format` | `audio` (the default) or `sse`, which needs `pcm` |
| `speed`, `instructions` | OpenAI's members, as the options of the same names |
| any other option | every option of the vocabulary by its name ([c-api.md](c-api.md#options)), such as `language`, `seed`, `steps` or `temperature`, which the model checks |

A member speech.cpp does not take is refused rather than ignored, and so is `instructions` for a model that takes none,
such as Qwen3-TTS 0.6B. A request without `seed` gets one drawn, which `X-Speech-Seed` returns; the same request with that
seed gives the same audio on the same device.

Irodori-TTS speaks at most 30 s at a time, so the server speaks an `input` of several sentences one sentence at a time,
as `speech tts` does, with the same voice, options and seed, and a pause of 0.9 s between them. A `pcm` stream sends
the first sentence's audio as soon as it is made. A sentence too long for one request is cut at its commas, or at its
spaces; a run of text with neither that is too long is refused (400, `param` `input`). Qwen3-TTS speaks `input` whole,
up to 24565 tokens.

| Response | What it sends |
|---|---|
| `wav` | the whole file, 16-bit mono at the model's rate, once the speech is made, with the headers `X-Sample-Rate`, `X-Speech-Seed` and `X-Speech-Stop` (`complete`, `max_seconds` or `model_limit`) |
| `pcm` | raw 16-bit little-endian mono at the model's rate, `Content-Type: audio/pcm`, streamed as the model makes it, with `X-Sample-Rate` and `X-Speech-Seed`. The headers leave before the speech ends, so they cannot carry the stop reason |
| `pcm` with `stream_format: "sse"` | the same PCM as server-sent events: `{"type":"speech.audio.delta","audio":"<base64 PCM>"}` for each chunk, then `{"type":"speech.audio.done","seed":42,"samples":134400,"stop":"complete"}`. OpenAI's done event carries the usage in tokens, which speech.cpp does not count |

```sh
# A WAV file
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/speech -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"input": "明日の東京は晴れです。", "voice": "ono_anna"}' -o out.wav

# PCM played as it arrives; the rate is the X-Sample-Rate header (24000 for Qwen3-TTS, 48000 for Irodori-TTS)
curl -sN http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/speech -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"input": "明日の東京は晴れです。", "voice": "ono_anna", "response_format": "pcm"}' |
    ffplay -nodisp -autoexit -f s16le -ar 24000 -ch_layout mono -i -
# On Linux with ALSA: ... | aplay -f S16_LE -r 24000 -c 1

# Server-sent events
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/speech -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"input": "明日の東京は晴れです。", "voice": "ono_anna", "response_format": "pcm", "stream_format": "sse"}'
```

From Python with [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io), streaming PCM into a WAV file as it arrives:

```python
import requests
import wave

with requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/speech",
                   json={"input": "明日の東京は晴れです。", "voice": "ono_anna", "response_format": "pcm"},
                   stream=True) as r:
    r.raise_for_status()
    with wave.open("out.wav", "wb") as w:
        w.setnchannels(1)
        w.setsampwidth(2)
        w.setframerate(int(r.headers["X-Sample-Rate"]))
        for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=None):
            w.writeframes(chunk)
```

## Transcriptions

A transcription request is a `multipart/form-data` form, as OpenAI's API takes it. The upload may be up to 25 MB,
OpenAI's limit.

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `file` | the audio, required: a WAV file, 16-, 24- or 32-bit PCM or 32-bit float at any rate, its channels averaged and resampled to the model's rate. Any other file is refused with a 400 (`param` `file`); convert it first (`ffmpeg -i in.mp3 out.wav`) |
| `model` | the recognition model's `id`, or left out; any other model is a 404 (`model_not_found`) |
| `language` | a tag of one of the model's languages, or `auto` (the default) |
| `prompt` | what the model is told of the audio before it hears it, for a model that takes it (Qwen3-ASR) |
| `response_format` | `json` (the default), which answers `{"text":"..."}`; `text`, the text alone as `text/plain`; or `verbose_json` (below). `srt`, `vtt` and `diarized_json` are refused: speech.cpp gives neither subtitles nor speakers |
| `timestamp_granularities[]` | `segment`, with `verbose_json`; a model that gives no times refuses it. `word` is refused |
| `decoding` | speech.cpp's own: `beam` (the default) or `greedy`, for a model that takes it (reazonspeech-nemo-v2) |
| `chunking_strategy` | `auto`, or OpenAI's `server_vad` object: recognize each region where the detection model finds that someone speaks (below) |

`verbose_json` answers `{"task":"transcribe","language":…,"duration":…,"text":…,"segments":[{"id":0,"start":…,"end":…,"text":…}]}`.
`duration` is the file's length in seconds. `language` is the tag of the language Qwen3-ASR heard (`ja`, or `ja,en` for a
long recording in several), and is left out by FastConformer, which names none. `segments` come from a model that gives
times (FastConformer). Members the recognizers have no value for are left out.

Every answer carries `X-Speech-Stop`: `complete`, or `model_limit` when the model reached the most tokens it writes, with
the text written up to there. OpenAI's other members (`temperature`, `stream`, `include[]` and the rest) are refused with
a 400 rather than ignored.

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions -F file=@utterance.wav -F response_format=text
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions -F file=@meeting.wav -F response_format=verbose_json
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions -F file=@meeting.wav -F language=ja -F prompt="Claude Code、渋谷"
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions -F file=@meeting.wav -F decoding=greedy   # reazonspeech-nemo-v2
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions -F file=@meeting.wav -F chunking_strategy=auto
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions -F file=@meeting.wav \
    -F 'chunking_strategy[type]=server_vad' -F 'chunking_strategy[silence_duration_ms]=800'
```

### By regions

With `chunking_strategy`, the detection model finds where someone speaks in the file, each region is recognized alone,
and the texts are joined in order, with a space between two regions unless either side is Japanese or Chinese text.
`segments` have the times of the whole file, and `language` lists the languages heard in order. A file in which no one
speaks gives an empty text. A recognizer given a long stretch with several sentences can drop whole sentences, and write
words where no one speaks; by regions it hears one or a few sentences at a time.

`chunking_strategy=auto` takes the defaults below. A `server_vad` object goes as OpenAI's SDKs send it in a form, one
field per member:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `chunking_strategy[type]` | | `server_vad`, required with the others |
| `chunking_strategy[threshold]` | 0.5 | the speech probability from which audio counts as speech, 0 to 1 |
| `chunking_strategy[prefix_padding_ms]` | 300 | the audio kept before and after each region |
| `chunking_strategy[silence_duration_ms]` | 500 | the silence that ends a region |

A region is at most 10 s long, cut at its longest silence. A request with `chunking_strategy` to a server without a
detection model is a 400 that says to give it one: `speech serve reazonspeech-v2 silero-vad`.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="unused")
with open("meeting.wav", "rb") as f:
    print(client.audio.transcriptions.create(model="reazonspeech-nemo-v2", file=f, chunking_strategy="auto").text)
```

## Realtime transcription

`/v1/realtime` speaks OpenAI's Realtime API over a WebSocket, for a transcription session: the client appends audio as
it records it, and the server answers with the text of each utterance, which the client commits itself, or which, with
`turn_detection` `server_vad`, the detection model finds. OpenAI's client connects to it by its base URL alone:

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="unused")
with client.realtime.connect(model="reazonspeech-nemo-v2") as connection:
    connection.session.update(session={"type": "transcription", "audio": {"input": {
        "format": {"type": "audio/pcm", "rate": 24000}, "transcription": {"language": "ja"}, "turn_detection": None}}})
    pcm = open("utterance.raw", "rb").read()   # 16-bit little-endian mono PCM at 24000 Hz
    connection.input_audio_buffer.append(audio=base64.b64encode(pcm).decode())
    connection.input_audio_buffer.commit()
    for event in connection:
        if event.type == "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed":
            print(event.transcript)
            break
```

The address is `ws://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/realtime`, with `?model=` the recognition model's `id` or nothing. The
session transcribes with the recognition model held, and starts with `turn_detection` `null`: the client commits each
utterance.

| Client event | What it does |
|---|---|
| `session.update` | sets `session.audio.input.transcription`: `model` (the recognition model's `id`), `language`, or `languages` with one tag, and `prompt`, each left as it was when left out and taken away by `null`; or `null`, after which commits are not transcribed. Sets `turn_detection`: `null`, or `{"type": "server_vad"}` with `threshold`, `prefix_padding_ms` and `silence_duration_ms` (below). `session.type` is `"transcription"`, the format `{"type": "audio/pcm", "rate": 24000}`, and `noise_reduction` `null` |
| `input_audio_buffer.append` | adds `audio`, base64 of 16-bit little-endian mono PCM at 24000 Hz |
| `input_audio_buffer.commit` | transcribes the buffer: what was appended since the last commit or clear |
| `input_audio_buffer.clear` | drops the buffer |

| Server event | When |
|---|---|
| `session.created`, `session.updated` | on connecting, and after each `session.update`, with the whole configuration |
| `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` | with `server_vad`, once speech has begun and lasted long enough to be kept, with `audio_start_ms` and the `item_id` of the utterance |
| `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` | with `server_vad`, once the utterance has ended, with `audio_end_ms` and its `item_id` |
| `input_audio_buffer.committed` | at once for a commit, or with `server_vad` after `speech_stopped`, with its `item_id` and the `previous_item_id` |
| `input_audio_buffer.cleared` | for a clear |
| `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta` | while the utterance goes on: text that adds to the end of what came before (below) |
| `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` | once the utterance is recognized whole, with the `transcript`, the whole text, which replaces the deltas; `usage` `{"type": "duration", "seconds": …}`, `languages` where the model names them (Qwen3-ASR), and speech.cpp's own `stop`, `complete` or `model_limit` |
| `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.failed` | an utterance the model could not transcribe, with OpenAI's error object |
| `error` | an event the server does not take, with OpenAI's error object and the client's `event_id` |

While an utterance goes on, the server recognizes it again as audio comes, as often as the model keeps up, and the
deltas carry the beginning that two of these readings in a row agree on. They may stop short of the text, or differ
from it where a later reading changed its mind: a client shows them while someone speaks and replaces them with the
completed `transcript`, as it does for OpenAI's `gpt-live-transcribe`.

Utterances are transcribed one after another, each in its turn among the server's other transcriptions, taken when it
is committed. A session holds at most 25 MB of audio not yet transcribed, in its buffer or committed, which is 546 s;
an append past that is an `error` event (`input_audio_buffer_full`) and adds nothing. A member or a value
speech.cpp does not take is an `error` event rather than ignored: a conversation session (`session.type: "realtime"`),
`semantic_vad`, the members of `server_vad` that steer a response (`create_response`, `interrupt_response`,
`idle_timeout_ms`), `noise_reduction`, the formats `audio/pcmu` and `audio/pcma` and rates other than 24000, `include`
(log probabilities), `keywords`, `delay`, more than one language, and every other client event.

### Turn detection

With `turn_detection` `server_vad`, the detection model finds where someone speaks, as `chunking_strategy` does in a
file, and each region is an utterance, committed and transcribed as it ends: the same audio gives the same regions and
texts as `chunking_strategy` with the same values. A server without a detection model answers `server_vad` with an
`error` event that says to give it one: `speech serve reazonspeech-v2 silero-vad`.

| Member | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `threshold` | 0.5 | the speech probability from which audio counts as speech, 0 to 1 |
| `prefix_padding_ms` | 300 | the audio kept before and after each utterance |
| `silence_duration_ms` | 500 | the silence that ends an utterance |

An utterance is at most 10 s long, cut at its longest silence. `speech_started` comes about 0.85 s after the speech
begins, once it is certain to be kept, and the utterance is committed about 0.6 s after the speech ends. The buffer
keeps only the utterance under way, or the last moments of silence, so a session can stay open through silence; a
commit while `server_vad` runs transcribes it as an utterance, the one that `speech_started` named if speech is under
way, and a clear drops it, and in both cases turn detection begins again on the audio that follows.

A connection that the server refuses gets an HTTP error before the WebSocket opens: a server without a recognition
model (404, or 503 while the page loads one), a model other than the recognition model held (404), a query member other
than `model` (400), a web page of an origin `--cors-origin` does not allow (403),
and, while the server listens on 127.0.0.1, `::1` or `localhost`, a Host other than those names with the server's port
(403), as for the page. While the page loads another recognition model, a commit fails with `model_loading`; once it is
loaded, a session that named no model goes on with it, and one that named the previous model, in the address or in
`session.update`, fails with `model_not_found`. A session with `server_vad` lets the detection model go when the page
replaces it, committing the utterance under way, and goes on with the new one.

## Errors

Errors have OpenAI's shape, `{"error":{"message":...,"type":...,"param":...,"code":...}}`, and `param` is the input at
fault:

| Category | HTTP | `type` | `code` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `invalid_argument` | 400 | `invalid_request_error` | `invalid_value` |
| `unsupported` | 400 | `invalid_request_error` | `unsupported_parameter` |
| `out_of_range` | 400 | `invalid_request_error` | `unsupported_value` |
| `model_file`, `device`, `out_of_memory`, `io`, `internal` | 500 | `server_error` | the category's name |

So an unknown voice is a 400 `unsupported_value` with `param` `voice`, and a `speed` on Qwen3-TTS a 400
`unsupported_parameter`. A member the server does not have is a 400 `unknown_parameter`.

A refused request gets its error status before any audio. An error while a stream runs ends a `pcm` stream early, which
the client reads as a broken transfer, and an SSE stream with `{"type":"error","error":{...}}`.

## The page

`speech serve --open` opens a page on which to try models without writing a request.

- Three tabs: Speak, Transcribe and Live. At the top of each, a picker lists the catalog's models of its task with
  their sizes, whether they are fetched and their languages. Picking one fetches it, with progress that can be
  cancelled and is resumed the next time, and loads it in place of the model of its task. Transcribe and Live use the
  same recognition model.
- Speak takes a text and the model's options, plays the speech as the server streams it, and can play it again, save it
  as a WAVE file or hand it to Transcribe. For Irodori-TTS it makes a voice from a recording dropped on it or recorded in
  the browser.
- Transcribe takes an audio file in any format the browser decodes, or a recording, and shows the text, the language
  heard, the time it took and the segments. A second picker there holds a detection model: with one, the audio is
  transcribed by the regions where someone speaks (`chunking_strategy`); without one, audio up to a minute is
  transcribed whole, and longer audio asks for one, since a FastConformer model loses sentences of a long stretch and
  parakeet's memory grows with the square of its length.
- Live transcribes the microphone while you speak. The text that can still change is shown in grey and updated as
  often as the model keeps up.
- Transcribe sends a file whole, or, where it is larger than the server takes in a request, in pieces of about
  12 minutes cut at a pause. Live sends what it records in pieces of at most 20 s, or as long as set, each cut at a
  pause. The texts of the pieces are joined.
- The page is built into `speech` and needs nothing from the network.

The server prints the page's address, `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`. Other web pages cannot use it: the server refuses a
request from another origin than its own, and a Host other than 127.0.0.1, `localhost` or `[::1]` with its port. It is
served while the server listens on 127.0.0.1, `::1` or `localhost`. To use it from another machine, forward the port with SSH, the same number at both
ends (`ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 host`), and open the printed address in your browser. The page loads only models of the catalog,
and removes none; `speech rm` does.
