# speech quantize makes every weight type from the F32 file, as the layout tables store each tensor

Decided 2026-10-08.

## Context

Up to 0.7.1 each converter quantized: `reference/<model>/convert.py --type q8_0` or `--type f16` wrote the file of that
type with gguf-py, each converter choosing by a kind of its own which tensors take the type, and each family's
`layout.cpp` listed the types its reader took for each tensor. Two places decided one thing. FastConformer's converter
wrote F16 and F32 alone, and no converter wrote a type below 8 bits: gguf-py 0.19 quantizes Q8_0, Q4_0, Q5_0 and a few
others, and none of the K-quants (Q6_K, Q5_K, Q4_K), which ggml quantizes (`ggml_quantize_chunk()`). Making a type took
the Python environment and the checkpoint.

ASIST and others pin the released F16 and Q8_0 files by SHA-256.

A K-quant's block holds 256 values of a row. The rows of some matrices are not whole blocks of it: Qwen3-ASR 0.6B's
encoder and projector, 896 wide; FastConformer's prediction network and joint, 640; Irodori-TTS's AdaLN, of rank 192,
the DiT's feed-forward output, 3680, the speaker encoder's input, 128, and its feed-forward output, 1996, which is not
whole blocks of Q8_0's 32 either. Some weights reach operations that ggml runs from F16 or F32 alone: Qwen3-ASR's
convolution kernels through `ggml_im2col()`, and FastConformer's through `ggml_conv_2d_direct()`,
`ggml_conv_2d_dw_direct()` and `ggml_ssm_conv()`. The matrices and embeddings of every family are read by
`ggml_mul_mat()` and `ggml_get_rows()` alone, which ggml v0.25.3 runs from every K-quant on the CPU, Metal and Vulkan
(each backend's `supports_op`).

On the nine released models, ggml's Q8_0 and F16 are gguf-py's on every tensor, and `speech quantize` of each F32 file
writes the released F16 and Q8_0 files byte for byte (`tools/quantize_compare.py`, 2026-10-08).

## Decision

- **The library quantizes.** `speech_quantize()`, added in the C API's 3.1, and `speech quantize IN OUT --type`
  write a model file of F32 weights in F16, Q8_0, Q6_K, Q5_K or Q4_K with ggml's own quantizers, on the CPU. They
  take F32 weights alone: a quantized file is not quantized again, and F16 weights are refused too, since a type made of
  them would hold other bytes than the same type made of the F32 weights, under the same name.
- **The layout tables decide each tensor's type.** A `TensorSpec` carries a `Storage`: for a file of each weight type,
  the types the tensor takes in order, of which the file holds it in the first whose blocks its rows are whole blocks of.
  The reader takes a tensor in any of its storage's types, so that the choice can change without refusing the files
  made before; `speech quantize` writes the one the rule gives. Three storages serve the four families: `kQuantized`
  for a matrix or embedding that only `ggml_mul_mat()` and `ggml_get_rows()` read, `kHalf` for Qwen3-TTS's codec and
  Qwen3-ASR's convolution kernels, F16 in every file but an F32 one, as the released files hold them, and `kFloat32`.
  Nothing else chooses a type.
- **A tensor a type cannot hold takes the next wider type the storage lists.** In a K-quant file a matrix whose rows
  are not whole blocks of 256 values takes Q8_0, and F16 where they are not whole blocks of 32; the same F16 stands for
  Q8_0 in a Q8_0 file, as the converters did. A weight whose operation reads F16 or F32 alone has no quantized type in
  its storage at all.
- **The converters write F32 alone.** F16 goes as well as Q8_0: `speech quantize` writes the converters' F16 byte for
  byte, and a converter that kept it would be a second place deciding the types.
- **A file names the release that reads it.** `speech.requires` becomes the latest of the input's own, the first
  release that reads the weight type's `general.file_type`, which every family reads alike, and the first release whose
  reader of the family takes each tensor in its type, which each storage gives per type from the family's history: 0.7's
  FastConformer reader took its matrices in F16 and F32 alone, where the other families' took Q8_0 as well. A Q6_K, Q5_K
  or Q4_K file and a FastConformer file of layout 1 in Q8_0 name 0.8.0, and the other F16 and Q8_0 files of layout 1
  0.7.0, so that they are the released ones. A reader from 0.8.0 that does not know a file's `general.file_type`, or finds a tensor in a type
  its layout does not list, names the release `speech.requires` gives when it comes after its own, as a newer layout is
  refused. `general.file_type` is 18 (MOSTLY_Q6_K), 16 (MOSTLY_Q5_K_S) or 14 (MOSTLY_Q4_K_S), the one of gguf-py's two
  values for Q5_K and Q4_K that names no mix of wider types, and the file is named `-Q6_K`, `-Q5_K` or `-Q4_K`.
- **The metadata is copied from the file's own bytes.** gguf's writer writes a tensor's axes up to its last above 1,
  where gguf-py writes every axis of the numpy array: through it a kernel of width 1, `[768, 768, 1]` in a released
  file, would become `[768, 768]`, and the file would differ from the released one.
- **Lower bit widths are extra files**, offered beside the recommended type with their measured accuracy, never as
  the recommended file.

The alternatives were turned down:

- Quantizing in the converters, with gguf-py. It does not quantize the K-quants, and the converters and the tables
  would both decide the types.
- Q5_0, Q5_1 or IQ4_NL for a matrix a K-quant cannot hold, as llama.cpp substitutes them. Each is a type more for every
  backend and every check, where Q8_0 already runs everywhere and is checked.
- One first release per weight type for every family. A FastConformer file in Q8_0 would name 0.7.0, which refuses it.
- A reader that takes a tensor only in the type the rule gives for the file's weight type. The rule could then never
  change without refusing the files made under the one before.
- A `speech.layout` raised for the K-quant files, so that releases before 0.8.0 would name the release. A layout says
  which keys and tensors a file holds, which a Q4_K file holds as an F16 one does, and the F16 and Q8_0 files that
  0.7 reads are of the same layout.
- Writing the metadata through gguf's writer, which would change the released files' bytes as above.

## Consequences

Converting a model is two steps, and the F32 file, 8.1 GB for the 1.7B models, is written first. Releases before 0.8.0
refuse a Q6_K, Q5_K or Q4_K file because its `general.file_type` is none they know, and a FastConformer file in Q8_0
because its matrices are of a type their layout does not list, each without naming 0.8.0. FastConformer's
files can be Q8_0 and K-quants. Qwen3-ASR 0.6B's encoder, 896 wide, is Q8_0 in its K-quant files, and FastConformer's
prediction network and joint, 640 wide, too.
