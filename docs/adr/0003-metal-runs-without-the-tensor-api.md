# Metal runs without the tensor API

Superseded in part by docs/adr/0014: the library sets `GGML_METAL_TENSOR_DISABLE` only while its ggml lists its devices, and restores it.

Decided 2026-10-01.

## Context

ggml v0.25.3 runs Metal's matrix products through Metal 4's tensor API on the M5, M6, A19 and A20, and
through its older simdgroup kernel on earlier chips. On an Apple M5, the tensor-API `kernel_mul_mm` writes
past its output when the output's column count is 64 modulo 128, whatever the weights' type. In a graph the
stray writes land in the next tensor of the allocator's buffer, so the result is garbage that changes from
run to run. One of 64 Irodori-TTS samples hit it: its third codec window spanned exactly 64 frames, and the
second half of the sentence came out as noise. Any graph can hit it, whether through frames, text tokens or
a Qwen3-TTS prompt.

ggml's own `test-backend-ops` has no case of that shape and passes; two added cases fail with a sentinel
mismatch and pass with `GGML_METAL_TENSOR_DISABLE=1`. A two-line change to the kernel's store also makes
them pass (issue #13). ggml-org/llama.cpp master at 0c1e570 has the same kernel, and the defect has not
been reported there.

On the M5, over the 20 sentences of speech-bench and against the tensor API:

| | Tensor API | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| Irodori-TTS MF F16, median first audio | 0.19 s | 0.23 s |
| Irodori-TTS F16 at 16 steps, median first audio | 0.85 s | 1.12 s |
| Qwen3-TTS 0.6B Q8_0, median first audio | 0.045 s | 0.043 s |
| Irodori-TTS codec decoder against the official, F32 | 47.6 dB | 68.0 dB |

## Decision

Every tool sets `GGML_METAL_TENSOR_DISABLE` in `configure_ggml()` before ggml lists its devices, on macOS
only, so Metal runs the simdgroup kernel on every chip.

The alternatives were turned down. Carrying the kernel fix would mean a fork of ggml as the submodule,
against keeping ggml as the one pinned dependency. Avoiding the shape, for instance by changing the codec's
windows, would leave the DiT, the text encoder and Qwen3-TTS exposed.

## Consequences

On the M5, Irodori-TTS takes a fifth to a third longer to its first audio, still under audio.cpp's 1.22 s
at 16 steps; Qwen3-TTS keeps its speed. Metal comes closer to the CPU in every check. When a ggml release
passes the two cases of issue #13 with the tensor API, the setting goes and the M5 numbers in README.md are
measured again.
