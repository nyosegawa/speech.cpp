# C API

This page describes the C API, `include/speech.h`, through which every program reaches the models
([ADR 0005](adr/0005-every-program-speaks-through-one-c-api.md)). The header documents each function; this page shows
the shape of a program and the rules that hold across functions.

## A program

A program that speaks one sentence:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "speech.h"

static int on_audio(const float * samples, size_t n, void * user_data) {
    /* n mono float samples at the model's sample rate, at least one. Returning nonzero stops the request. */
    return 0;
}

static int check(speech_status status) {
    if (status < 0) {
        const char * option = speech_last_error_option();
        fprintf(stderr, "%s (%s): %s\n", speech_status_name(status), option ? option : "-", speech_last_error());
    }
    return status >= 0;
}

int main(void) {
    speech_model * model = NULL;
    speech_request * request = NULL;
    if (check(speech_model_load("Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice-Q8_0.gguf", NULL, &model)) &&
        check(speech_request_new(model, &request)) &&
        check(speech_request_set_text(request, "明日の東京は晴れです。")) &&
        check(speech_request_set_string(request, SPEECH_OPT_VOICE, "ono_anna")) &&
        check(speech_request_set_int(request, SPEECH_OPT_SEED, 42)) &&
        check(speech_synthesize(request, on_audio, NULL))) {
        const speech_result * result = speech_request_result(request);
        printf("%s, seed %lld, %llu samples\n", speech_stop_name(speech_result_stop(result)),
               (long long) speech_result_seed(result), (unsigned long long) speech_result_samples(result));
    }
    speech_request_free(request);
    speech_model_free(model);
    return 0;
}
```

A recognition of mono samples at any rate, with the times of its segments:

```c
if (check(speech_model_load("parakeet-tdt_ctc-0.6B-ja-F16.gguf", NULL, &model)) &&
    check(speech_request_new(model, &request)) &&
    check(speech_request_set_audio(request, samples, n_samples, 48000)) &&
    check(speech_request_set_bool(request, SPEECH_OPT_TIMESTAMPS, 1)) &&
    check(speech_transcribe(request))) {
    const speech_result * result = speech_request_result(request);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < speech_result_segment_count(result); i++) {
        double start, end;
        const char * text;
        speech_result_segment(result, i, &start, &end, &text);
        printf("%.2f %.2f %s\n", start, end, text);
    }
}
```

The library loads files and never reaches the network: a program passes a model file's path. `speech pull NAME` prints
the path of a model of the catalog.

Link `libspeech` from a release archive ([install.md](install.md#release-archives)). On Windows, define `SPEECH_SHARED`
and link `speech.lib`. Inside this CMake project, link the target `speech` (shared) or `speech-static`.

## Functions

- **Loading.** `speech_model_load()` loads a model from its one GGUF file, which holds its codec, and chooses the family
  from the file's `general.architecture`. A file of a layout this library does not read is refused with a message that
  names the release that reads it ([gguf.md](gguf.md)). Its parameters, from `speech_load_params_new()` or NULL for the
  defaults, are the same for every family:
  - the device: `auto` (the default: the first GPU, or the CPU when there is none), `gpu`, `cpu`, or a device's name,
    compared without case. A device asked for by `gpu` or by name that is not there or does not start is an error, and
    no other device takes its place.
  - the CPU's threads, which apply to whatever runs on the CPU; by default the machine's performance cores, or its
    physical cores where the system does not tell them apart.
  - a warm-up that runs a short request while the model loads, so that a GPU compiles its kernels before the first
    request. It is off by default; `speech worker` and `speech serve` turn it on.
- **Model information.** `speech_model_info_open()` reads what a model file says of its model from its metadata, without
  its weights or a device: its identity, architecture and layout, task and sample rate, languages, voices, whether it
  takes voice files and the codec they must carry, the longest text, the options it takes, its sizes, and every metadata
  entry. `speech_model_get_info()` gives the same for a loaded model, with the device, the threads in effect and the
  voices added. `speech_model_info_text_tokens()` counts a text's tokens as a synthesis counts them against the longest
  text, so that a caller can split a long text first. `speech_model_info_json()` writes the whole as one JSON object
  (below).
- **Quantizing.** `speech_quantize()` (added in 3.1) writes a model file of F32 weights in F16, Q8_0, Q6_K, Q5_K or Q4_K,
  each tensor in the type its family's layout gives it in a file of that type ([gguf.md](gguf.md#weight-types)), on the
  CPU. It refuses a file whose weights are not F32, naming `model_path`, and an unknown type, naming `type`.
- **Voices.** `speech_voice_add()` adds a voice to a loaded model from a voice file or a reference WAVE file at any rate.
  `speech_voice_make()` writes a voice file from a reference, reading only the codec's encoder from the model file.
  `speech_voice_make_from()` writes one from the parameters `speech_voice_params_new()` makes: several references
  (`speech_voice_params_add_reference()`), another loudness (`speech_voice_params_set_loudness()`) or the recordings' own
  (`speech_voice_params_keep_loudness()`), or a speaker-inversion embedding instead
  (`speech_voice_params_set_embedding()`). A model that takes no voice files answers all three with
  `SPEECH_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED` ([models/irodori-tts.md](models/irodori-tts.md#voices)).
- **Requests.** `speech_request_new()` makes a request for one model. It takes a text (`speech_request_set_text()`) or
  audio (`speech_request_set_audio()`), and options through the setter of each option's type. `speech_synthesize()`
  passes the audio to its callback as it is made, and `speech_transcribe()` recognizes the whole audio at once.
  `speech_request_set_progress()` gives a callback that hears how far a request has come while it passes no audio.
  `speech_request_cancel()` stops a request, from any thread, at the next audio, step or stage; a request cancelled
  before it runs returns at once. Either returns `SPEECH_CANCELLED`.
- **Results.** `speech_request_result()` gives what a request that returned `SPEECH_OK` or `SPEECH_CANCELLED` did: why it
  stopped (`complete`, `max_seconds`, `model_limit` or `cancelled`), the seed of a synthesis, the samples it passed, and
  the text of a recognition with its segments and tokens when the request set `timestamps`, and the languages it heard
  (`speech_result_language_count()`, `speech_result_language()`), none for a model that names none, such as
  FastConformer, and none for a cancelled request. The seed is the request's, or one the library drew
  from 0 to 2^53 - 1, with which the same request repeats its audio on the same device.
- **Devices.** `speech_device_count()`, `speech_device_name()`, `speech_device_description()`,
  `speech_device_get_kind()` and `speech_device_memory()` list the CPU and the GPUs a model can run on, in ggml's order.
  An accelerator that ggml runs beside the CPU, such as BLAS, is not listed.
- **Logs.** `speech_log_set()` sends the library's messages and ggml's to a callback. Until it is called, warnings and
  errors go to stderr and the rest is dropped.

On macOS, the library turns off Metal 4's tensor API for its own ggml: it sets `GGML_METAL_TENSOR_DISABLE` while ggml
first lists its devices, and then restores it, so a host's own ggml keeps the tensor API. ggml's matrix kernel with that
API wrote past its output on the M5 ([ADR 0003](adr/0003-metal-runs-without-the-tensor-api.md)).

## Requests

- Each value is checked against what the model declares as it is set, and the request as a whole when it runs, before
  any work ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-the-c-api-checks-requests-against-the-options-each-model-declares.md)). A refused value
  or request is left as it was, to be fixed and run again. A request that has started its work runs once.
- Audio may be at any rate. The library resamples a recording to recognize, and a reference recording of a voice, to the
  model's rate (`speech_model_info_sample_rate()`), and never the audio it makes. It uses the method of torchaudio's
  `functional.resample()` with the parameters of librosa's `kaiser_best`. Audio at the model's rate passes unchanged. Two
  rates whose ratio in lowest terms has a term above 4096 (44101 and 16000 Hz) are refused.
- Text is normalized as each model's reference normalizes it: NFKC of Unicode 13.0 for Irodori-TTS, and NFC of Unicode
  9.0 for Qwen3-TTS and Qwen3-ASR. Text that is not in NFC, such as Japanese copied from a macOS file name, gets the
  tokens of its NFC.
- A text longer than `speech_model_info_max_text_tokens()` is `out_of_range`, option `text`.
- Audio shorter than two of the model's mel frames (20 ms for FastConformer) is `out_of_range`, option `audio`. Qwen3-ASR
  pads audio under 0.5 s and takes any.
- A recognition stops at `model_limit` when it reaches the most tokens the model writes (4096 for Qwen3-ASR), with the
  text written up to there.
- Audio that comes out not finite is never passed on: the request ends with `out_of_range` naming no option
  ([ADR 0032](adr/0032-no-synthesis-passes-audio-that-is-not-finite.md)).
- Nothing is cut short or moved to another device behind the caller's back, and the library checks what it is given
  before ggml sees it.

## Errors

A function that can fail returns a `speech_status`, negative for an error, whose category says what kind of failure it
is. `speech_status_name()` gives its name, `speech_last_error()` the message, and `speech_last_error_option()` the input
it concerns (an option's name, `text`, `audio`, `device`, `threads`, `name`, `path`, or a parameter's name for
`speech_voice_make()` or `speech_quantize()`), on the same thread. No C++ exception crosses the API.

| Status | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SPEECH_OK` | `ok` | the call did what it was asked |
| `SPEECH_CANCELLED` | `cancelled` | `speech_request_cancel()` or a callback stopped the request |
| `SPEECH_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT` | `invalid_argument` | the caller's mistake: a NULL pointer, an empty text, a value of the wrong type, a required option left out, a request run again after its work |
| `SPEECH_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED` | `unsupported` | the model cannot do it: an option it does not take, at a value other than the neutral one, or the other task |
| `SPEECH_ERROR_OUT_OF_RANGE` | `out_of_range` | a value the model does not take: outside its range or choices, or a text too long |
| `SPEECH_ERROR_MODEL_FILE` | `model_file` | a model or voice file that cannot be used |
| `SPEECH_ERROR_DEVICE` | `device` | a device that is not there, does not start, or fails while it computes |
| `SPEECH_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | `out_of_memory` | the host's or the device's memory ran out |
| `SPEECH_ERROR_IO` | `io` | a file that cannot be opened, read or written |
| `SPEECH_ERROR_INTERNAL` | `internal` | a defect of the library |

## Ownership, threads and versions

- **Ownership.** Every object the library returns is freed only through the function named for it. Every string it
  returns lives as long as the object it was read from: an information's until `speech_model_info_free()`, a result's
  until `speech_request_free()`, the version, a device's and a name's (`speech_option_name()`, `speech_status_name()`,
  `speech_stop_name()`) as long as the process, and the error message until the next call on the thread. Nothing the caller passes is kept after the call.
- **Threads.** A model serves one request at a time; requests that several threads run on the same model wait for each
  other. A request is used by one thread at a time, but `speech_request_cancel()` may be called from any thread.
  Information never changes once made and may be read from any thread. Separate models are independent.
- **Versions.** `speech_version()` gives the release the library was built from (`"0.7.1"`). `SPEECH_API_VERSION_MAJOR`
  and `SPEECH_API_VERSION_MINOR`, and `speech_api_version_major()` and `speech_api_version_minor()` for a caller that
  loads the library at run time, give the API's version, 3.1. The major rises when a declaration changes in a way an
  existing caller notices, and the minor when a function, an option or an enum value is added. A program built against
  M.m runs against a library of the same major version and a minor version of m or more. The shared library's SOVERSION
  is the major version (`libspeech.3.dylib`, `libspeech.so.3`).

## Options

What a request may ask of a model is one vocabulary of options (`speech_option`), each with a name in snake_case
(`speech_option_name()`, `speech_option_from_name()`) and one type. Every entry point uses the same name: a member of the
worker's messages and the server's speech request, and a flag in kebab-case on the command line (`--duration-scale`).
Each family declares the options it takes in one table in its engine (`src/<family>-engine.cpp`), with ranges and
defaults from its model file. `speech info MODEL` lists them for a model.

| Option | Type | Neutral | Taken by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `voice` | string | none | [Qwen3-TTS](models/qwen3-tts.md#options), [Irodori-TTS](models/irodori-tts.md#options); required |
| `language` | string | `auto` | every model |
| `seed` | int | none | Qwen3-TTS, Irodori-TTS |
| `speed`, `seconds`, `duration_scale`, `steps` | float, float, float, int | 1, none, 1, none | Irodori-TTS |
| `max_seconds` | float | none | Qwen3-TTS |
| `timestamps` | bool | false | [FastConformer](models/fastconformer.md#use) |
| `prompt` | string | `""` | [Qwen3-ASR](models/qwen3-asr.md#options) |
| `decoding` | string | none | reazonspeech-nemo-v2 |
| `do_sample`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `temperature`, `repetition_penalty` | bool, int, float, float, float | none | Qwen3-TTS |
| `code_predictor_do_sample`, `code_predictor_top_k`, `code_predictor_top_p`, `code_predictor_temperature` | bool, int, float, float | none | Qwen3-TTS |
| `instructions` | string | `""` | Qwen3-TTS 1.7B, Irodori-TTS files of layout 2 |
| `cfg_scale_text`, `cfg_scale_speaker`, `cfg_guidance_mode`, `cfg_min_t`, `cfg_max_t`, `truncation_factor`, `rescale_k`, `rescale_sigma`, `speaker_uncond_mode`, `sway_coeff`, `speaker_kv_scale`, `speaker_kv_min_t`, `speaker_kv_max_layers`, `cfg_scale_instructions` | float, but `cfg_guidance_mode` and `speaker_uncond_mode` string and `speaker_kv_max_layers` int | none | Irodori-TTS v4.1-Small (RF) |
| `keep_tail`, `tail_window_size`, `tail_std_threshold`, `tail_mean_threshold` | bool, int, float, float | none | Irodori-TTS |

- A value at an option's neutral value is accepted by every model. Any other value of an option a model does not take is
  `unsupported`. An option whose neutral value is "none" has none.
- A string option's value is one of its choices. `voice`, `decoding`, `cfg_guidance_mode` and `speaker_uncond_mode` are
  compared with case; `language` also takes `auto` and a region or script of a choice, compared without case.
- A number outside the range is `out_of_range`.
- An option "steers" when it changes what the model does. A language that is only "checked" is compared with the model's
  languages and then not used.
- A required option left out is `invalid_argument` when the request runs.

## Model information as JSON

`speech_model_info_json()` writes one object, its members in this order. A member that does not apply is left out rather
than null. `speech info --json` prints it, the worker's `ready` and `info` carry it as `model`, and the server's model
object as `speech`, so every program that shows a model shows the same. This is `Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice-Q8_0.gguf`
loaded on Metal, with two of its nine voices and four of its options shown:

```

- `organization` to `weight_type` are the model's identity, from the general keys of its file ([gguf.md](gguf.md)).
  `finetune` and `version` are left out for a model whose name has none. `source` is the repository the file was
  converted from and the revision. `weight_type` is the type that holds most of the weights: `F32`, `F16`, `Q8_0`, `Q6_K`, `Q5_K` or `Q4_K`.
- `architecture` is the family ([models.md](models.md#families)), and `layout` is the version of the family's layout
  that the file has.
- `incremental` is true for a model that passes audio while it still makes the rest (Qwen3-TTS), so that its first
  audio does not wait on the length of the text, and false for one that makes a request's whole speech before it decodes
  it (Irodori-TTS).
- Each voice's `language`, `gender` and `description` are `""` where the file does not say; a voice added from a voice
  file or a recording says none. A recognition model has no `voices`, `incremental` or `max_text_tokens`.
- `voice_files` is true for a model that takes voices made from recordings; `voice_codec` then follows it, the hash a
  voice file must carry.
- An option has `type` (`string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`), `required`, `steers`, and where they apply `default`,
  `minimum` or `exclusive_minimum`, `maximum`, and `choices`.
- `device` and `threads` are there for a loaded model alone. `threads` is the number of CPU threads in effect for a model
  on the CPU, and 0 for a model on a GPU. Setting threads is never an error, since with the device `auto` a caller cannot
  know where the model will run.
