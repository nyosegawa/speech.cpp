# Irodori-TTS

This page describes speech.cpp's port of Aratako's [Irodori-TTS](https://github.com/Aratako/Irodori-TTS), which speaks
Japanese in the voice of a reference recording, a sentence at a time.

| Name | Upstream | File |
|---|---|---|
| `irodori-tts-mf` | [Aratako/Irodori-TTS-v4.1-Small-MF](https://huggingface.co/Aratako/Irodori-TTS-v4.1-Small-MF) | `Irodori-TTS-866M-MF-v4.1-F16.gguf`, 1.92 GB |
| `irodori-tts` | [Aratako/Irodori-TTS-v4.1-Small](https://huggingface.co/Aratako/Irodori-TTS-v4.1-Small) | `Irodori-TTS-859M-v4.1-F16.gguf`, 1.91 GB |

v4.1-Small-MF samples in 4 MeanFlow steps. v4.1-Small samples in Euler steps (40 by default) with guidance, which makes
it slower and lets a request tune more.

```sh
speech voice irodori-tts-mf me.wav me.voice.gguf
speech tts irodori-tts-mf --add-voice me=me.voice.gguf --voice me -o out.wav "明日の東京は晴れです。"
speech tts irodori-tts --add-voice me=me.voice.gguf --voice me --steps 16 --speed 1.2 -o out.wav "明日の東京は晴れです。"
```

## What it does

A diffusion transformer makes a whole sentence's speech, its length predicted beforehand, and a 48 kHz codec decodes it.

- The text is normalized as the official runtime does it. The 56 emoji the model reads as directions are kept: 🤭 a
  giggle, 😮‍💨 a sigh, 👂 a whisper and the rest of the runtime's `ALLOWED_ANNOTATION_EMOJIS`.
- Without a reference, the model chooses the voice itself (the voice `none`).
- A caption describes the voice and the way of speaking (the option `instructions`, the runtime's VoiceDesign).
- A speaker-inversion embedding, which the official training learns for a speaker, becomes a voice file.
- The speech ends where the model goes silent, rather than at the predicted length.

Not supported: LoRA adapters and the watermark. A seed gives other audio than the same seed in the official runtime.

## Voices

A voice is one of these:

- **`none`**: the model chooses the voice. It is listed first among the voices.
- **A reference WAVE file** of at most 120 s, at any rate. Adding it encodes it each time, which takes 0.4 to 0.7 s for
  10 s of audio.
- **A voice file**, which `speech voice` writes once from one or more references. It loads in under 0.03 s and works
  with both models in any type; a model of another codec refuses it.
- **A voice file of a speaker-inversion embedding**, which `speech voice` makes from the `.speaker.safetensors` file the
  official training saves. It works only with the model it was made for.

A voice file may join several references, up to 120 s together. Each is brought to the model's loudness, -16 LUFS, or to
another (`--lufs`), or kept as recorded (`--keep-loudness`). `--add-voice` and the worker's `add_voice` take one file at
the model's loudness, so a voice of several references or another loudness is made into a voice file first.

```sh
speech voice irodori-tts-mf take-1.wav take-2.wav take-3.wav --lufs -23 three-takes.voice.gguf
speech voice Irodori-TTS-859M-v4.1-F16.gguf my-speaker.speaker.safetensors my-speaker.voice.gguf
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Range and notes |
|---|---|---|
| `voice` | required | `none`, or a voice added since loading |
| `language` | `auto` | `ja`; only checked |
| `seed` | drawn | 0 to 2^53 - 1 |
| `steps` | 4 (MF), 40 (RF) | 1 or more |
| `seconds` | none | 0.5 to 30: fixes the length instead of predicting it |
| `duration_scale` | 1 | above 0: multiplies the predicted length |
| `speed` | 1 | 0.25 to 4: divides the length, as [Irodori-TTS-Server](https://github.com/Aratako/Irodori-TTS-Server) does with OpenAI's `speed` |
| `instructions` | `""` | the voice and the way of speaking in words, at most 512 tokens |
| `keep_tail` | false | keep the whole length, rather than end where the speech goes silent |
| `tail_window_size`, `tail_std_threshold`, `tail_mean_threshold` | 20, 0.05, 0.1 | how silence is found: this many frames with a spread and a mean under these |

v4.1-Small (RF) also takes the runtime's sampling settings. v4.1-Small-MF takes none of them: MeanFlow folded the guidance
into its training.

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `cfg_scale_text`, `cfg_scale_speaker`, `cfg_scale_instructions` | 3, 5, 3 | the guidance's scales; 0 turns that condition's guidance off |
| `cfg_guidance_mode` | `independent` | `joint` guides every condition in one branch at one scale; `alternating` guides one condition a step, in turn |
| `cfg_min_t`, `cfg_max_t` | 0.5, 1 | the guidance runs while the step's time lies between them |
| `speaker_uncond_mode` | `mask` | `noise` replaces the speaker with noise in the unguided branch |
| `sway_coeff` | 0 | Sway Sampling: below 0 the steps gather near the noise, above 0 near the speech; the runtime's own `sway` uses -1 |
| `truncation_factor` | none | multiplies the starting noise |
| `rescale_k`, `rescale_sigma` | none | temporal score rescaling; both or neither |
| `speaker_kv_scale` | 1 | above 1, the speech follows the voice more closely |
| `speaker_kv_min_t`, `speaker_kv_max_layers` | 0.9, 12 | the steps and layers that `speaker_kv_scale` applies to |

`speech info` shows each option's range. A request whose options contradict each other, or set one that another leaves
without effect, is refused before any work, naming the option: `seconds` with `duration_scale`, for example, or the
guidance's settings with both scales at 0.

A request speaks at most 30 s. A text whose speech the model predicts to last longer is refused with `out_of_range`
(`text`), with the predicted length in the message, and so is a text of more than 256 tokens. A few sentences can pass
30 s, so a request should be one sentence; `speech tts` and `speech serve` speak a longer text a sentence at a time. A
`speed` above 1 that brings the length within 30 s is followed.

## Instructions

`instructions` describes the voice and the way of speaking: 「落ち着いた女性の声で、近い距離感でやわらかく自然に読み上げてください。」.
With a reference, the speech keeps the reference's voice and follows the description where it can. With the voice
`none`, the description alone chooses the voice:

```sh
speech tts irodori-tts-mf --voice none --instructions "低く落ち着いた男性の声で、ゆっくりと読み上げてください。" \
    -o out.wav "明日の東京は晴れです。"
```

## Streaming

The model makes a sentence's whole speech before any audio, then decodes it in windows and passes each one on: the first
0.48 s, then windows sized to stay ahead of playback. The windows do not change the audio, so a seed repeats its
samples.

## Accuracy

Every stage is checked against the official implementation's tensors on an Apple M5:

| Check | CPU, F32 | Metal, F32 | Vulkan, F16 model and F32 codec |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normalization and tokens, 164 texts | all equal | all equal | all equal on the 51 texts without emoji |
| Decoded audio | 119 dB SNR | 68 dB | 68 dB |
| Whole synthesis from the official noise | 75 to 110 dB, the official length | 22 to 61 dB, the same length | 58 dB (MF), the same length |

On a GPU the audio is the same speech rather than the same waveform, since the GPU's matrix kernels round differently.

## Speed

speech-bench on 2026-10-08: the 20 sentences of its `prompts/speak-ja-JP.json` in a voice file of one reference, seed
1, one request at a time through the worker, F16. The CER is of the speech as Qwen3-ASR 1.7B hears it.

| Model | Device | Median first audio | p90 first audio | Real-time factor | CER |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v4.1-Small-MF, 4 steps | Apple M5, Metal | 0.25 s | 0.52 s | 0.17 | 6.1% |
| v4.1-Small, 16 steps | Apple M5, Metal | 1.24 s | 3.40 s | 0.34 | 3.2% |
| v4.1-Small-MF, 4 steps | RTX 2080, Vulkan | 0.12 s | 0.20 s | 0.07 | 7.1% |
| v4.1-Small, 16 steps | RTX 2080, Vulkan | 0.52 s | 1.12 s | 0.13 | 3.2% |

The first audio waits for the whole sentence's sampling, so it grows with the sentence. v4.1-Small's default of 40
steps takes about 2.4 times as long as 16. The worker takes 2.2 GB of memory with F16 weights, and 1.5 GB with Q8_0,
which speaks as fast.
