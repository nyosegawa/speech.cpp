# Qwen3-TTS

This page describes speech.cpp's port of Qwen's [Qwen3-TTS](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice)
CustomVoice models, which speak ten languages with nine named speakers and pass their audio as they make it.

## What it does

- It speaks with the model's nine speakers ([models.md](../models.md#voices)). The 1.7B model also follows an
  instruction of how to speak.
- Audio starts as soon as the first 0.08 s frame is made and keeps coming in small chunks, so a player can start on the
  first chunk. The chunks join without artifacts, and the same request with the same seed gives the same samples.
- A long text costs memory in proportion to its length.

Not supported: voice cloning and VoiceDesign, which are other Qwen3-TTS models.

## Options

| Option | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `voice` | required | one of the nine speakers |
| `language` | `auto` | `de` `en` `es` `fr` `it` `ja` `ko` `pt` `ru` `zh`; it steers the model |
| `seed` | drawn | 0 to 2^53 - 1 |
| `max_seconds` | none | stop the speech at this length |
| `instructions` | `""` | 1.7B only: how to speak, in words (`怒った口調で`, "Speak slowly and softly.") |
| `do_sample` | true | draw each token, or take the most likely one |
| `top_k` | 50 | the most likely tokens a draw keeps; 0 keeps all |
| `top_p` | 1 | the smallest set of tokens whose probability reaches it |
| `temperature` | 0.9 | what the logits are divided by |
| `repetition_penalty` | 1.05 | how much a token already taken is held back |
| `code_predictor_do_sample`, `code_predictor_top_k`, `code_predictor_top_p`, `code_predictor_temperature` | true, 50, 1, 0.9 | the same for the code predictor, which the official package calls `subtalker_dosample` and the rest |

The sampling options take transformers' names, and their defaults are the official ones. The model has no control of its
rate or length, so `speed`, `duration_scale` and `seconds` are refused, and so are `top_k`, `top_p` and `temperature`
when `do_sample` is false. A request stops at `max_seconds` or at the model's limit of 655 s, and the result says which.

## Accuracy

Every stage is checked against the official implementation's tensors:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Codec decoder, CPU, F32 | 114 dB SNR from the official decoder |
| Codec decoder in a synthesis's chunks against the whole utterance | 132 dB SNR in F32 on the CPU, 64 dB with a Q8_0 file on Metal |
| Talker and code predictor, F32, CPU and Metal | the official choice on every frame; greedy decoding gives the official frames |
| Tokenizer | the official tokens on 27 texts, and the official text of 1191 sequences of ids |

## Speed

speech-bench on 2026-10-08: the 20 sentences of its `prompts/speak-ja-JP.json` with the speaker `ono_anna`, one
request at a time through the worker, Q8_0. The CER is of the speech as Qwen3-ASR 1.7B hears it.

| Model | Device | Median first audio | p90 first audio | Real-time factor | CER |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.6B | Apple M5, Metal | 0.038 s | 0.054 s | 0.31 | 5.8% |
| 1.7B | Apple M5, Metal | 0.060 s | 0.110 s | 0.42 | 3.0% |
| 0.6B | RTX 2080, Vulkan | 0.031 s | 0.039 s | 0.27 | 8.0% |
| 1.7B | RTX 2080, Vulkan | 0.039 s | 0.052 s | 0.32 | 2.8% |

On the RTX 2080 the 0.6B model takes 1.6 GB of video memory and the 1.7B 2.7 GB.
