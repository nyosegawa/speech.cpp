# Silero VAD

This page describes speech.cpp's port of [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad), which finds where
someone speaks in a recording, so that a recognizer can be given one utterance at a time.

| Name | Upstream | Languages | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| `silero-vad` | [snakers4/silero-vad](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad), the 16 kHz model of v6.2 | any; it takes none | `silero-vad-309K-v6.2-F32.gguf`, 1.2 MB |

```sh
speech vad silero-vad meeting.wav                                  # FILE, START and END of each region, in seconds
speech vad silero-vad --format json one.wav two.wav > regions.jsonl
speech vad silero-vad --min-silence-duration-ms 1000 --max-speech-duration-s 10 meeting.wav
```

## What it does

- The model gives a speech probability for every 32 ms of audio, each with the 4 ms before it and what it heard before,
  and the regions follow from the probabilities by the rule of the official `get_speech_timestamps()`, with its options.
  speech.cpp gives the official's regions sample for sample.
- Audio at any rate is resampled to 16 kHz first. The times are seconds from the start of the audio.
- A file without speech, or with silence and faint noise alone, has no region.
- The model takes no language, and its `language` is `auto` alone.
- Audio that arrives a piece at a time, as from a microphone, gives the same regions through the C API's detections
  ([c-api.md](../c-api.md#detections)), each as soon as it is certain: with the defaults, about 160 ms after the speech
  ends, once 100 ms of silence has ended the region.
- The file is F32 alone: `speech quantize` writes no other type of it.
- `speech worker` and `speech serve` do not take it; `speech vad` and the C API's `speech_detect()` and detections do.

## Options

| Option | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `threshold` | 0.5 | from 0 to 1: the probability from which a chunk is speech. A region ends below the threshold less 0.15, or 0.01 at least |
| `min_speech_duration_ms` | 250 | a shorter region is dropped |
| `min_silence_duration_ms` | 100 | how long the probability stays below the end's threshold before a region ends |
| `speech_pad_ms` | 30 | added before and after each region; two regions closer than twice it share the silence between them |
| `max_speech_duration_s` | none | the longest a region may be, its padding included. A longer one is cut at its longest silence of more than 98 ms, or where it reaches the limit |

Read speech pauses for breath often, and with the defaults a region is a sentence or less. To give a recognizer a few
sentences at a time, join them with a longer `min_silence_duration_ms` and bound them with `max_speech_duration_s`: on a
minute of read German, a silence of 1000 ms gave 3 regions of 13 to 15 s, and a limit of 10 s cut them into 6 of 5 to
8 s.

## Accuracy

Checked against silero-vad 6.2.3 on six inputs, 122 s in all, of FLEURS and Common Voice clips, silence and noise: every
stage, then the probabilities from the audio, then the regions of seven sets of options, the defaults and 10 s and 3 s
limits among them. On an Apple M5:

| Device | Probabilities, largest difference from the official | Regions |
|---|---|---|
| CPU, F32 | 3.6e-6 | the official's, all 42 |
| Metal | 3.7e-6 | the official's, all 42 |

The same inputs at 16, 24 and 48 kHz, given a piece at a time in pieces of one sample, 20 ms, 100 ms, 1 s and random
sizes, give the regions of the whole audio on both devices.

## Speed

A minute of audio on an Apple M5, after the model's load of 0.04 s: 0.033 s on the CPU and 0.057 s on Metal, a real-time
factor of 0.0006 and 0.0010. The official package takes 0.150 s on the same CPU.

The same minute given a piece at a time, as audio arrives:

| Pieces | CPU | CPU, one thread | Metal |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 ms | 0.20 s | 0.12 s | 0.67 s |
| 100 ms | 0.08 s | 0.10 s | 0.25 s |
| 1 s | 0.04 s | 0.08 s | 0.08 s |

A piece computes the chunks it completes in a graph of their own, and a small graph's time is mostly what the device
takes to start computing. For audio that arrives as it is said, load the model on the CPU, with one thread for pieces of
20 ms: a push then takes about 0.1 ms, and the GPU is left to the recognizer.
