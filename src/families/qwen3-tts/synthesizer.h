 * RTX 2080 (Vulkan) and 0.136 s after it on an Apple M5 (Metal), where a frame takes 24 ms and 34 ms to make, so a
 * player that starts on the first chunk's 0.08 s ran dry for 16 to 59 ms in each of speech-bench's 20 Japanese
 * sentences (2026-10-07). Chunks of 1 and 2 frames keep it fed while the speech gets ahead of it, and 4 frames from
 * then on keep the codec's calls few: each takes about 16 ms on the M5's Metal whether it decodes 1 frame or 4 (a
 * rough measure on a shared GPU), and 4 frames bound how long a cancel and the worker's silence last, as before. The
 * sizes are fixed rather than following the measured speed, since the codec's samples depend, by rounding, on how the
 * frames are grouped into calls, and the same request with the same seed gives the same samples.
