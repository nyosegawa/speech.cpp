 * What qwen-asr's normalize_audio_input() and transformers' Qwen3ASRFeatureExtractor do to audio at the model's rate
 * (qwen_asr/inference/utils.py and transformers/models/qwen3_asr/feature_extraction_qwen3_asr.py): the whole audio's
 * samples divided by their peak when it exceeds 1 (normalize()), before qwen-asr splits audio too long for the model;
 * then, for each utterance, one shorter than qwen3-asr.audio.min_samples padded with zeros to it, and Whisper's log-mel
 * (features()): a centred STFT with reflected padding and a periodic Hann window, the power of every frame but the last
 * through a Slaney mel filterbank, its log10 floored at log_floor, floored again at the utterance's largest value less
 * dynamic_range, and shifted by log_offset and divided by log_divisor.
 *
 * It runs on the host in double precision rather than in a ggml graph, as FastConformer's frontend does: it costs a
 * few milliseconds a second of audio, and Metal's matrix kernel rounds its inputs to half precision, which the log
 * of the quiet frames' power would magnify.
